# Introduction

<!-- Freshwater ecosystems need regulatory oversight -->

Freshwater ecosystems provide humanity with clean drinking water and
food, they ensure livelihoods for fisheries and farms, and they are
places of high recreational and aesthetic value [@bene2016contribution;
@borger2021value; @youn2014inland]. Combined, these contributions to
people, also called ecosystem services, are estimated to have an annual
worth of more than four trillion dollars [@costanza2014changes], which
corresponds approximately to a twentieth of the global GDP as of 2017
[@WorldBank2021]. Human activities have reduced biodiversity in
freshwater ecosystems [@Darwall2018; @almond2020living] and are thereby
endangering these systems' capacities to provide ecosystem services
[e.g. @cardinale2011biodiversity; @Duffy2017; @Grizzetti2019].

The Living Planet Index indicates that populations of freshwater
vertebrates on average declined by 84% relative to their 1970 levels,
though this estimate is biased downwards by few extreme cases
[\@Leung2020]. Based on the same data, @He2019 found a slightly stronger
decline (88%) in freshwater megafauna. Declining abundances have also
been recorded for invertebrates [e.g. @cumberlidge2009freshwater;
@Baranov2020], however, most studies find stable or ambiguous trends in
abundance and richness [@Floury2013; @VanKlink2020; @Outhwaite2020]
though often associated with strong taxonomic and functional turnover
[@Haubrock2020; @Jourdan2018; @Mouton2020]. The main stressors to which
this situation can be attributed are well known and can be summarized as
overexploitation, water pollution, flow modification, habitat
degradation and species invasions [@Dudgeon2006; @Vorosmarty2010]. This
set is complemented by emerging new stressors such as microplastics and
light pollution [@Reid2018] and complex interactions between
co-occurring stressors [@Schinegger2012; @Birk2020; @Comte2021]. To
prevent unacceptable harm to freshwater ecosystems and secure the supply
of ecosystem services, internationally coordinated action and regulatory
frameworks are necessary [@Darwall2018; @Tickner2020; @VanRees2020].

<!-- WFD       -->

The Water Framework Directive (WFD) is among the major regulatory
frameworks that aim to protect and restore freshwater systems in the
European Union. It aims to reach or maintain a 'good ecological status'
for all water bodies in the European Union [@EuropeanCommission2000].
Since its implementation in 2000, the WFD has motivated improvements in
methods for biomonitoring [@Birk2012; @Carvalho2019], advanced our
knowledge of the ecological status of freshwater systems throughout
Europe [@kristensen2018european] and has stimulated relevant research at
the science-policy interface [@reyjol2014assessing]. It has not,
however, reached its explicit aim, to achieve 'good ecological quality'
for most surface and groundwater bodies by 2015. As of 2018, only 40% of
surface water bodies had reached this status [@kristensen2018european].
The member states of the EU use national methods to assess their water
bodies. To harmonize the national assessment methods and to ensure a
coherent notion of 'good ecological quality', an intercalibration
process has been initiated. A recent output of the intercalibration
process is a pan-European typology of lentic and lotic freshwater
systems [broad river types (BRT), @LycheSolheim2019]. While the WFD
required its members to create river typologies for the assessment,
these typologies differ widely in the number of river types they discern
(between 1 and 367) and the variables used to define them (between 2 and
16). The recent effort by @LycheSolheim2019 combined the national
typologies and connected the new, broad river types with the established
intercalibration types [@Birk2013; @poikane2014intercalibration]. This
pan-European typology has already been used to compare nutrient
threshold values across river types [@Poikane2019], and in studies
examining interaction types of multiple stressors [@Birk2020] and the
chemical pollution of European surface waters [@Posthuma2020].

<!-- Not biologically validated  -->

The BRT-typology adopts the type descriptors that are most commonly used
in national typologies: catchment size, altitude, geology, region and
flow. The first three descriptors are part of the System A approach
outlined in the Annex II of the WFD and @LycheSolheim2019 largely follow
the thresholds proposed there. While System A includes an ecoregion
descriptor that recognizes 25 distinct regions throughout Europe, the
region descriptor used by @LycheSolheim2019 only separates between the
Mediterranean and the rest of Europe. Flow is also considered as a
binary variable (perennial / intermittent) and was only applied to
Mediterranean rivers. Whether this typology based on geographical and
environmental attributes matches biological classifications remains
unknown. @Verdonschot2006b suggests that System A-type typologies only
partially capture the major drivers or macroinvertebrate distributions
in Europe, which he found to be temperature, slope/ flow velocity and
river size. The status assessment of the WFD relies on stable
type-specific reference conditions. If biological communities vary
strongly between reference sites of the same river type erroneous
assessments resulting in over- or underprotection are more likely. If no
reliable type-specific reference conditions can be established, e.g. due
to high natural variability, a river type might be excluded from the
status assessment [@EuropeanCommission2000].


<!-- What we did  -->

Following the BRT-typology, we classified observations from a data set
of freshwater macroinvertebrate occurrences to find the taxa that
commonly occur in each river type. These typical taxa can be used to
identify least impaired conditions or to compare the sensitivity of
communities towards stressors between river types. In addition, we used
cluster validity metrics to compare the BRT-typology to three other
freshwater typologies. While BRT classifies river reaches, earlier
typologies classified ecoregions. Two of the typologies we evaluated
were such regional typologies. They are simpler to use in practical
application since their basic spatial units are larger and the water
body type is easier to determine in the field. Because practical
applications is the main purpose of freshwater typologies, reach-based
typologies need to have better classification performance to legitimate
their added complexity.
