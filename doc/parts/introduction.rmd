<!-- Proposed order by Sebastian Birk: 

I wonder if the sequence of elements in the introduction needs to be modified, to be more concise, consistent and non-repetitive. It would also help to shape a more objective notion with regard to our investigation. And overall, the introduction as it stands now is too long.

My idea is as follows (=one paragraph per item):
1.	 General relevance of rivers for the society (my 1.)
2.	 Environmental regulation and role of typologies
3.	 Two main typology approaches: “regional” versus "segmental”
   a.	 Regional in HD, but also referred to in WFD (Illies)
   b.	 Segmental in WFD
4.	 Role of “Segmental” approach for bioassessment
   a.	 Specific habitat conditions  biotic communities to be expected  “natural reference conditions”
   b.	 Strong typology (=little within-type and sign. between-type difference of biotic communities) = indispensable baseline for water management
   c.	 Concept of “biological validation of typology” 
5.	 “Broad river typology” system as recent attempt to define pan-European river types. We check if fit for bioassessment-purpose (apart from all other purposes of the approach, see comment below), by comparing with too alternative “regional” typology systems.

<!-- 1. freshwater systems -- 
 - Why do we care about them 
 - They are in danger 
 - We need to legislature to protect them
-->

Freshwater ecosystems provide clean drinking water and food, ensure livelihoods for fisheries and farms, regulate our climate and hold high recreational and aesthetic value [@bene2016contribution; @borger2021value; @youn2014inland]. 
Lakes and rivers provide ecosystem services worth over 2.5 trillion dollars annually [2010US\$,@costanza2014changes] - approximately three percent of the global Gross Domestic Product as of 2017 [2010US\$, @WorldBank2021]. 
However, human activities are reducing biodiversity in freshwater ecosystems [@Darwall2018; @almond2020living] and are thereby altering these systems' capacities to provide ecosystem services [e.g. @cardinale2011biodiversity; @Duffy2017; @Grizzetti2019].
To prevent unacceptable harm to freshwater ecosystems and secure the supply of their services, internationally coordinated action and regulatory frameworks are necessary [@Darwall2018; @tickner2020bending; @van2021safeguarding].

<!-- 2. The WFD -- 
 - short intro to wfd 
 - national typologies 
 - now we have an international one
 - end with not yet biologically verified
--> 

The European Water Framework Directive [WFD, @EuropeanCommission2000] is among the major regulatory frameworks intended to protect and restore freshwater systems in the European Union (EU). 
Since its implementation in 2000, the WFD has motivated improvements in methods for biomonitoring [@Birk2012; @Carvalho2019], advanced our understanding of the ecological status of freshwater systems throughout Europe [@kristensen2018european] and has stimulated research at the science-policy interface [@reyjol2014assessing].
With the implementation, policymakers aspired to achieve *good ecological status* for most European surface and groundwater bodies by 2015.
However, only 40% of surface water bodies had reached this status in 2018 [@kristensen2018european].
The underlying status assessments differ between EU countries, as each uses a set of national methods [@Birk2012]. 
To harmonize them and ensure a coherent notion of *good ecological status*, the EU initiated an intercalibration process.
A recent output of this process are the *broad river types*, a pan-European typology of lotic freshwater systems [@LycheSolheim2019].

<!-- 3. Typologies in general -- 
- what are typologies?
- what kind of typologies exist?
- what are they used for?
-->

Most environmental regulatory frameworks summarize their focal ecosystems in typologies.
With typologies we can formulate expectations of target properties of every single water body without actually having to monitor each one [@hughes1988ecoregions], which would be prohibitively expensive at large spatial scales. 
These properties can be nutrient and pollutant thresholds [e.g. @Poikane2019] or the composition of ecological communities [e.g. @sanchez2007concordance]. 
Instead of predicting the target property directly based on local conditions, the water body is first assigned to the appropriate type based on the local conditions and the expectations are then formulated for each type based on a set of representative samples. 
To be useful, typologies do not need to suppose that these properties are constant within types - only that within-type variation is negligible compared to between-type variation.
There has been considerable disagreement about the spatial scale typologies should operate on.
Possible scales range from microhabitat systems, like fine gravel patches, that merely span centimeters to ecoregions that can cover many hundred square kilometers [@frissell1986hierarchical].
The different spatial scales entail different geometries and topologies of the basic mapping units.
The basic unit of a typology that is based on regions is a polygon and usually, each type occurs only once (e.g. Tundra, Eastern Balkan or Fennoscandian-Shield).
Most river reaches share their type with the reaches feeding and draining them as well as with all near reaches. 
Reaches with different types are only close at the borders between different regions. 
The basic spatial unit in a typology of river reaches is a line segment.
Each type is assigned to many mapping units that are not necessarily contiguous. 
Instead, the landscapes are usually mosaics of different types.
Because typologies are models [@goodwin1999fluvial; @Loveland2004], there is not one correct scale or mapping unit.
Instead, the optimal spatial scale and hence geometry depends on the purpose of the typology.  

For the European area, multiple typologies of both types have been proposed.
Two regional typologies that are already used in European regulatory frameworks are Illies Freshwater Ecoregions [@illies1978limnofauna] and the Biogeographic regions [@EuropeanEnvironmentalAgencyEEA2016].
Illies Freshwater Ecoregions are proposed as regions in the WFD Annex II and based on the distribution of 75 taxonomic groups. 
The Biogeographic regions are used by the Habitats Directive (92/43/EEC) and Birds Directive (79/409/EEC 1979). They were initially based on a map of European vegetation [@Noirfalse1987] and later modified [@evansUsesMapNatural; @evansBuildingEuropeanUnion2012]. 
The broad river types are a reach-based typology.   

The WFD requires each EU member state to develop its own river typology. 
These national typologies vary widely in the number of river types they discern (between 1 and 367) and the features that are used to define their types [@LycheSolheim2019]. 
@LycheSolheim2019 combined the more than 1000 national river types into 20 river types and connected them with the established intercalibration types [@Birk2013; @poikane2014intercalibration].
As some of the initial 20 types were rare or deemed redundant, an aggregated version with 12 types was proposed. 
The broad river types adopt the type descriptors that are most commonly used in national typologies: catchment size, altitude, geology, region and flow. 
The first three descriptors are part of the System A approach outlined in Annex II of the WFD and @LycheSolheim2019 largely follow the class thresholds proposed there. 
While System A includes a region descriptor that recognizes 25 distinct regions throughout Europe, the
region descriptor used by @LycheSolheim2019 only separates between the Mediterranean and the rest of Europe. 
Flow is also treated as a binary variable (perennial/intermittent) and was only applied to rivers in the Mediterranean region.  
<!-- 5. biological validation -->
<!-- why does it matter   -->
<!-- What are reasons to doubt it? -->
Despite the quick adoption of the broad river types in the research community [e.g.  @Poikane2019; @birk2020impacts; @Posthuma2020], their biological validity remains to be established. 
In this context, a biologically valid typology is one, whose types delineate ecological communities with more similar species compositions within than between types. 
Numerous studies have evaluated the biological validity of the national typologies [e.g. @Lorenz2004;@Aroviita2008;@Davy-Bowker2006;@sanchez2007concordance;@Chaves2011;@Lazaridou2013;@Zahradkova2005] that were the starting point for the broad river types. 
However, neither the failure nor the success of these national typologies would necessarily imply that their combination maintains this quality. 

A potential issue of the broad river types as a classification of ecological communities pertains to the aforementioned topology of reach-scale typologies.
Instances of a type can be thousands of kilometers apart (e.g. RT4 (Medium-large, siliceous and organic lowland rivers) occur in northern Norway and northern Portugal) and close reaches often belong to other types.
Such a classification of ecological communities implicitly assumes that dispersal processes are overwhelmed by species sorting. 
Too much dispersal leads to mass effects and homogenization between adjacent reaches; 
too little dispersal hampers individuals reaching potentially favorable river reaches, which increases the variance within types [@Tonkin2018].
Regional typologies make less strict assumptions about dispersal as most nearby types belong to one type and the maximum distance between sites with the same type is usually lower. 
However, they are not able to track fine-scale environmental variations [@hughes1988ecoregions] that can affect community composition [@boyeroMultiscalePatternsSpatial2003; @barnesReappraisingEffectsHabitat2013], nor do they consider longitudinal patterns [@Hawkins2000] like those described in the River Continuum Concept [@Vannote1980].


In this paper, we aim to test whether the broad river types are a biologically valid typology of European freshwater systems and to evaluate the merits of reach-based and regional typologies. 
To this end, we will evaluate the three typologies by analyzing the within- and between-type similarities of macroinvertebrate communities and determining whether we can derive distinct typical communities for the types. 
The WFD uses four groups of organisms as so-called biological quality elements: macroinvertebrates, macrophytes, algae and fish.
A river typology within the WFD should therefore try to summarize the variability in each of these groups [@Dodkins2005], however, in this study, we will focus on macroinvertebrates. 

With these analyses, we will test three hypotheses:     
H1: Macroinvertebrate communities are more similar within than between types of broad river types, Illies Freshwater Ecoregions and the Biogeographic regions.   
H2: All three typologies delineate distinct typical and indicator assemblages.   
H3: According to the criterion of H1, the broad river types are a better classification of macroinvertebrate communities than either Illies Freshwater Ecoregions or the Biogeographic regions.

<!-- Nonetheless two general trends have emerged.  -->
<!-- Concurrent typologies often use either the ecoregional [e.g. @EuropeanEnvironmentalAgencyEEA2016; @Wasson2006, @Abell2008] or the reach scale [e.g. @LycheSolheim2019; @OuelletDallaire2019; @mcmanamay2019stream].  -->
<!-- While the former neglect longitudinal patterns within rivers (velocity, size and nutrient load) the latter of fail to account for spatial autocorrelation in variables of interest. -->

<!-- Examples for typologies, outside the WFD, are the Biogeographical Regions [@EuropeanEnvironmentalAgencyEEA2016] used for the definition of NATURA 2000 sites and the Major Land Resource Areas [@stal1981land] used in the USA for agricultural reporting and conservation programs. -->

<!--Early typologies where concerned with longitudinal patterns within streams [e.g. @theinemann1912bergbach; @huet1954biologie] but in the second half of the 20th century moved to in larger spatial scales that encompassed many streams [@Melles2012].  -->
<!-- This was in concert with the growing trend of conceptualizing rivers as the products of their catchments [@hynes1975stream;@lotspeich1980watersheds].  -->
<!-- A spatial unit that was comparable to, and sometimes confused with, ecoregions [@omernik1997distinguishing], and that naturally lend itself to large scale spatial mapping. -->
<!-- The latter trend was supported by the conterminous rise in GIS software and clustering algorithms [@Sokal1974]. -->
