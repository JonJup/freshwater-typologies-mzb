The mantel tests showed statistically significant correlations between most (362 out of 366) distance matrices. A more detailed description of the results is presented in the supplementary materials.

The ANOSIMs for all typologies, seasons and levels of anthropogenic impact were statistically significant (*p* < 0.01). 
The rank order of R statistics remained the same across seasons: Illies Freshwater Ecoregions before broad river types and biogeographic regions (Figure \@ref(fig:res-anosim)). 
Removing samples from catchments with considerable human impact lead to no or only modest increases in the R statistic, with the exception of Illies Freshwater Ecoregions for summer and autumn, where the increases were larger. 
The R values for the least impaired samples ranged between 0.08 (BGR, autumn) and 0.29 (IFE, autumn).

<!-- ## Classification strength --> 
All combinations of typology, season and level of human impact had positive classification strengths and pseudo-*p*-values below 0.05.
This indicates that for all three typologies, the within-type similarity is higher than the between-type similarity, irrespective of season or human impact. 
Within levels of anthropogenic impact, Illies Freshwater Ecoregions had the highest classification strength in all three seasons, followed by the broad river types and the Biogeographic Regions (Figure \@ref(fig:res-cs)). 
The highest overall classification strength was observed for Illies Freshwater Ecoregions in autumn and with the least impaired samples (0.1).
The impaired summer samples paired with the biogeographic regions obtained the lowest overall classification strength (0.02). 
Differences among seasons are most strongly pronounced in Illies Freshwater Ecoregions.
The other two typologies only showed slight variation across seasons.  
In all types and seasons, the least impaired samples received higher classification strengths than the impaired samples. 
The magnitude of this difference ranged between 0.003 (BRT, summer) and 0.03 (IFE, autumn).
The differences in classification strength result from different within-type similarities rather than different between-type similarities. 
The latter varied more strongly within than between typologies (Figure S5).

<!-- ## Indicator taxa --> 
The median indicator value of statistically significant indicator families from least impacted sites was higher for the typologies than for random groupings (Figure \@ref(fig:res-indval)), with the exception of Illies Freshwater Ecoregions for the summer samples. 
There was, however, considerable overlap between the distributions of real permuted indicator values. 
The highest median indicator value was observed for the summer samples with the Biogeographic Regions (0.41) and the lowest for the spring and summer samples with the broad river types (0.26).
Generally, the Biogeographic Regions had the highest median indicator values and the broad river types the lowest. 
Including impaired sites reduced the median indicator value for all but one combination of seasons and typologies (Figure S7), but variations between impaired and all samples were smaller than between different typologies.

```

<!-- Number of taxa --> 
The number of indicator families lay between 17 and 101 with an overall mean and standard deviation of 74.7 $\pm$ 20.2 (Figure \@ref(fig:res-indval-n)).
This was considerably higher than for the permuted data (5 $\pm$ 3). 
Including impaired samples increased the number of indicator families by between 8% (bgr, summer) and 176% (ife, summer) with a mean increase of 41.1 $\pm$ 52.2 %.
With the exception of least impaired summer samples with Illies Freshwater Ecoregion, all typologies had a higher number of indicator families than any of their permuted versions.

```


<!-- Typical communities -->

The Jaccard similarities between typical communities of all types were lower than any of the permutations they were compared against, resulting in pseudo-*p*-values of 0. 
The similarities were generally, though not always, lower when only samples from least impaired sites were considered (Figure S8) and did not show strong seasonal trends. 
In the samples from the least impaired sites (Figure \@ref(fig:res-typical)), the mean similarity was always lowest in Illies Freshwater Ecoregions, followed by the Biogeographic Regions and the broad river types. 
Lists of the typical communities are available as supplementary material and in Figures S9,S10 and S11.
