  abstract        = {1. Bioindicators of habitat quality and environmental change must be identified quantitatively and tested independently to confirm their usefulness. We used the indicator value (IndVal) method, which combines measures of habitat fidelity and specificity, to assess the indicator responses of dung beetles (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) in Tembe Elephant Park, South Africa. The indicator responses were verified by sampling in different areas of the Park, 2 years after the responses were originally quantified. 2. We postulated that terrestrial insect indicators with different combinations of habitat specificity and fidelity might fulfil different indicator roles. Indicator species with strong habitat specificity (characteristic species) are unlikely to provide information on the direction of ecological change despite high vulnerability. Rather, detector species that span a range of ecological states are likely to be better in this role. We used IndVal for selecting such detector species that indicate the direction of ecological change. 3. Sets of species were found to be robust bioindicators, i.e. reliably characteristic across the habitat of which they were indicative. The suite of indicators was refined by discarding those with IndVals that varied significantly across years, thus improving the confidence in the final suite of species selected. By clearly responding to a change in habitat between two ecological states, detector species provided information complementary to that provided by characteristic species. 4. The IndVal method enabled both the identification and testing of indicator (characteristic and detector) species. Because of its resilience to changes in abundance, IndVal is a particularly effective tool for ecological bioindication. 5. We conclude that both characteristic and detector species are useful bioindicators of habitat quality and conversion. We propose that bioindicators that are categorized and verified in this way will have valuable application in the monitoring of habitat integrity.},

  abstract        = {The indicator value (IndVal) of a species has long been the most popular measure to express species importance in community classifications. Nevertheless, a few problems concerning the original definition of IndVal still require clarification and some modifications are also in order so as to exploit the capabilities of the method more fully. In particular, we propose novel component terms (specificity, concentration and fidelity) that may be incorporated in the calculation of IndVal and also suggest some minor, although important terminological amendments. We argue that the choice among these terms should largely depend on whether the target classification is based on abundance or presence-absence data. The expanded capabilities of the approach and the sensitivity of IndVal variants to the sharpness of classifications are illustrated by actual examples coming from a benthic macroinvertebrate survey along the Danube River and a study of dolomite grassland communities in the Buda Hills, Hungary. We found that analyses by the original IndVal plus the new variants may give a more complete picture on any classification than a particular selection among component terms of IndVal. The use of several indices simultaneously is particularly recommended when selection of indicator species is the primary objective of the study. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The WFD descriptors 'System A' for stream types are too rigid and should be replaced by temperature, current, and size. The differences in average numbers of taxa between the 1660 sites distributed over Europe were either caused by differences between local environmental factors or by sampling effort, not by temperature, elevation, stream order or latitudinal position. The distribution patterns using all samples, only reference samples, and only degraded samples showed that human stress diminished the natural differences between stream communities and typologies should therefore be based on reference conditions. {\textcopyright} Springer 2006.},

  abstract        = {European countries have defined N1000 national river types and N400 national lake types to implement the EU Water Framework Directive (WFD). In addition, common river and lake types have been defined within regions of Europe for intercalibrating the national classification systems for ecological status of water bodies. However, only a low proportion of national types correspond to these common intercalibration types. This causes uncer- tainty concerningwhether the classification ofecological status is consistent across countries. Therefore, through an extensive dialogue with and data provision from all EU countries, we have developed a generic typology for European rivers and lakes. This new broad typology reflects the natural variability in the most commonly used environmental type descriptors: altitude, size and geology, as well as mean depth for lakes. These broad types capture 60–70{\%} ofall national WFD types including almost 80{\%} ofall European river and lake water bodies in al- most all EU countries and can also be linked to all the common intercalibration types. The typology provides a new framework for large-scale assessments across country borders, as demonstratedwith an assessment ofeco- logical status and pressures based on European data from the 2nd set of river basin management plans. The ty- pology can also be used for a variety of other large-scale assessments, such as reviewing and linking the water body types to habitat types under the Habitats Directive and the European Nature Information System (EUNIS), as well as comparing type-specific limit values for nutrients and other supporting quality elements across countries. Thus, the broad typology can build the basis for all scientific outputs ofmanagerial relevance related to water body types.},

  abstract        = {In the EU Water Framework Directive (WFD) a typological framework is defined for assessing the ecological quality of water bodies in the future. The conditions in the Directive impose a strong demand for `new' assessment systems. During the AQEM project an assessment system was developed for European streams using macroinvertebrates. The aim of this study was to test if the typology suggested in the WFD is useful for developing an assessment system for macroinvertebrates in streams. In total 889 streams of 29 stream types were sampled in eight countries all over the major geographical gradients in Europe. These stream types fit the WFD typological demands and fit to the major European geographic regions (ecoregions). The sites included gradients from reference conditions (for the definition see Nijboer et al., 2004) to sites with bad ecological quality. Despite standardisation there were large differences between the participating countries concerning the number of taxa, the number of specimens and the taxonomic resolution. The data, including macroinvertebrates and environmental variables were analysed by using Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA). The observed macroinvertebrate distribution largely supported the WFD typological criteria. This means that the major macroinvertebrate distribution patterns in European streams follow climatological and geomorphological conditions and are well distinguished in terms of stream types. Furthermore, it was shown that large scale factors affected the macroinvertebrate distribution even on a very fine scale. Most explanatory variables seemed to be scale independent. Even at a fine scale major factors concerning geology, geomorphology and hydrology added to the species occurrences. Within stream types morphology together with physico-chemistry best explained the macroinvertebrates distribution. In conclusion, the WFD typology is useful for an assessment system for streams using macroinvertebrates. The large scale factors were indeed the variables that explained most of the variation in species composition. But as these factors even strongly act at the scale of stream types, a further refinement is most probably necessary to disentangle typological actors from water quality ones.},

  abstract = {From headwaters to mouth, the physical variables within a river system present a con- tinuous gradient of physical conditions. This gradient should elicit a series of responses within the constituent populations resulting in a continuum of biotic adjustments and consistent patterns of loading, transport, utilization, and storage of organic matter along the length of a river. Based on the energy equilibrium theory of fluvial geomorphologists, we hypothesize that the structural and functional characteristics of stream conununities are adapted to conform to the most probable position or mean state of the physical system. We reason that producer and consumer communities characteristic of a given river reach become established in harmony with the dynamic physical conditions of the channel. In natural stream systems, biological communities can be characterized as forming a temporal continuum of synchronized species replacements. This continuous replacement functions to distribute the utilization of energy inputs over time. Thus, the biological system moves towards a balance between a tendency for efficient use of energy inputs through resource partitioning (food, substrate, etc.) and an opposing tendency for a uniform rate of energy processing throughout the year. We theorize that biological communities developed in natural streams assume processing strategies involving minimum energy loss. Downstream communities are fashioned to capitalize on upstream processing inefficiencies. Both the upstream inefficiency (leakage) and the downstream adjust- ments seem predictable. We propose that this River Continuum Concept provides a frame- work for integrating predictable and observable biological features of lotic systems. Implica- tions of the concept in the areas of structure, function, and stability of riverine ecosystems are discussed.},

  abstract        = {1. Comparative studies of distinct, but not ecologically isolated, systems such as lakes and streams may improve our understanding of the importance of ecological linkages in aquatic ecosystems. 2. In this study we compared the macroinvertebrate benthos of stony habitats in Swedish lakes and streams. Community composition was used to evaluate zoogeographic patterns and functional feeding guilds were used to identify mechanisms potentially affecting such patterns. 3. Stream communities were generally more diverse and species-rich and had a higher proportion of grazers, shredders and passive-filter feeders than lakes. Lake communities had a higher proportion of predators and collector-gatherers. Of the 10 most common taxa, only Leptophlebia mayflies, clams (Sphaeriidae) and the isopod Asellus aquaticus were recorded in both lakes and streams. 4. Among-site variance in macroinvertebrate communities accounted for by regional-scale variables was low (6.4{\%} for lakes and 10.1{\%} for streams), compared with that by local- scale variables (21{\%} for lakes and 37.6{\%} for streams). For lakes, the among-site variance in macroinvertebrate communities was best explained by habitat-scale characteristics followed by ecosystem, riparian, catchment, geographic position and ecoregion. For streams, the variance in macroinvertebrate communities was best explained by ecosystem characteristics followed by habitat, catchment, riparian, ecoregion and geographic position. 5. Conspicuous differences in spatial pattern were revealed between lakes and streams. For lakes, the most unequivocal differences in community composition and function occurred at the transition zone between the mixed forests in the south and the boreal coniferous forests in the north. Surprisingly, streams did not respond as strongly to profound landscape-level differences in climate and vegetation cover. 6. The spatial differences noted between macroinvertebrate communities of lakes and streams may be because of differences in retention of detrital matter. Our findings imply that detrital inputs are qualitatively similar, but that the retention and processing of coarse particulate organic matter was presumably higher in lake littoral regions than in stream riffle habitats. 7. Although our findings support the conjecture that species distribution is determined fundamentally by conditions prevailing at the local-scale, regional factors such as land use/type and the role of history were important and seemingly act as strong determinants of large-scale patterns in biodiversity.},

A single permutation procedure, utilising the same variables repeatedly but with different categorical divisions, enabled both the choice of variables and the boundary divisions for these variables to be optimised simultaneously in the development of the typology. This, in addition to a data set which appropriately combined different biological elements, enabled a typology to be developed which was far more effective than a System A, CCA-derived or expert opinion-based typology in segregating communities. This optimal typology could be used to improve the performance of ecological quality assessment methods. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

At genus level, streams located in the lowlands differ from streams in lower mountainous areas and the Alps, while the two latter groups were undistinguishable. At species level, a clear separation of different stream size classes is visible in the lowlands; a second gradient is related to the bottom substrate. Streams in the Alps can be distinguished from streams in lower mountainous areas at species level. Within the lower mountainous regions a size gradient is detectable, a less obvious gradient indicates catchment geology. The resulting "bottom-up" stream typology is compared to other stream typological systems in Germany.},

The clustering algorithms used are hierarchical, crisp (neural gas, self-organizing maps, hard competitive learning, k-means, maximin-distance, CLARA) and fuzzy (c-means, fuzzy competitive learning). To compare these methods we use two performance measures, namely the correlation coefficient and the weighted Jaccard coefficient (wJC). Both performance coefficients (PCs) clearly show that the neural gas and the k-means algorithm perform significantly better than all the other methods using our setup. For the hierarchical methods the ward linkage algorithm performs best under our simulation design. In conclusion, the neural gas method seems to be the best choice for fMRI cluster analysis, given its correct classification of activated pixels (true positives (TPs)) whilst minimizing the misclassification of inactivated pixels (false positives (FPs)), and in the stability of the results achieved. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract      = {Abstract: Global pressures on freshwater ecosystems are high and rising. Viewed primarily as a resource for humans, current practices of water use have led to catastrophic declines in freshwater species and the degradation of freshwater ecosystems, including their genetic and functional diversity. Approximately three‐quarters of the world's inland wetlands have been lost, one‐third of the 28 000 freshwater species assessed for the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List are threatened with extinction, and freshwater vertebrate populations are undergoing declines that are more rapid than those of terrestrial and marine species. This global loss continues unchecked, despite the importance of freshwater ecosystems as a source of clean water, food, livelihoods, recreation, and inspiration. The causes of these declines include hydrological alterations, habitat degradation and loss, overexploitation, invasive species, pollution, and the multiple impacts of climate change. Although there are policy initiatives that aim to protect freshwater life, these are rarely implemented with sufficient conviction and enforcement. Policies that focus on the development and management of fresh waters as a resource for people almost universally neglect the biodiversity that they contain. Here we introduce the Alliance for Freshwater Life, a global initiative, uniting specialists in research, data synthesis, conservation, education and outreach, and policymaking. This expert network aims to provide the critical mass required for the effective representation of freshwater biodiversity at policy meetings, to develop solutions balancing the needs of development and conservation, and to better convey the important role freshwater ecosystems play in human well‐being. Through this united effort we hope to reverse this tide of loss and decline in freshwater biodiversity. We introduce several short‐ and medium‐term actions as examples for making positive change, and invite individuals, organizations, authorities, and governments to join the Alliance for Freshwater Life.},

  abstract        = {Environmental policies increasingly focus on the enhancement of ecological functions across large geographical areas and thus call for biomonitoring tools that assess these functions at large spatial scales. A potential answer to this call would be to use general biological traits of organisms that indicate ecological functions, as such traits will be comparable among communities even across biogeographic regions that differ in their taxonomic composition. Here, we used benthic invertebrates and European running waters as example to illustrate how multiple biological traits could provide a measure for the large-scale biomonitoring of the functional composition of communities. Our measure considered the relative abundance of 63 categories of 11 biological traits (such as size, reproductive and dispersal potential, food and feeding habits) that indicate various ecological functions. Comparing this measure for 10 most natural French reference regions with 37 other most natural regions/stream types scattered across Europe demonstrated an extremely high spatial and temporal stability of the functional composition of natural invertebrate communities at the European scale. Thus, our functional measure corresponds to a fundamental standard for a large-scale biomonitoring tool, which is the stable and reliable indication of the natural reference state across ecoregions that differ more or less in their taxonomic composition. Applying our functional measure to regulated stream sites below dams (in England, Finland and Spain) and to streams receiving sewage inputs (in Wales, Poland and Sardinia) demonstrated highly significant (p {\textless} 10-6) differences in the functional composition between the human-impacted and the natural reference communities. In addition, some of the trait categories responded in a consistently contrasting way to each of the two types (regulation, sewage) of human impact. Consequently, our measure for the functional composition of invertebrate communities provides a first unified European baseline for future stream and river management: it was stable in the most natural but otherwise very different running water types across Europe, it safely indicated human impact, and it could potentially discriminate specific types of human disturbances. As all living organisms have multiple biological traits, our approach could serve to generate, for other types of communities and ecosystems, a set of large-scale biomonitoring tools that use similar and perhaps even comparable measures for the functional community composition.},

Using the Bathing Water Directive's water quality designation, the analysis shows that a one-level improvement in water quality leads to 3.13 more visits (+6.67%), whereas a one-level deterioration leads to 9.77 fewer annual visits (−20.83%). This study provides valuations of benefits of recreation and changes of recreational values due to changes in surface water quality, which can be compared to the implementation and monitoring costs of efforts under the EU's Bathing Water, Water Framework and Marine Strategy Framework Directives.},

We show European maps of ecosystem service capacity, flow (actual use), sustainability and efficiency. Then we ex- plore the relationship between the services and the ecosystem condition at the European scale, considering the ecological status ofaquatic ecosystems, reported under the EU Water Framework Directive, as a measure of the ecosystem integrity and biodiversity. Our results indicate that a higher delivery of the regulating and cultural ecosystem services analysed is mostly correlated with better conditions of aquatic ecosystems. Conversely, the use of provisioning services can result in pressures on the ecosystem. This suggests the importance ofmaintaining good ecological condition of aquatic ecosystems to ensure the delivery of ecosystem services in the future. These results at the continental scale, al- though limited to the ecosystemservices under analysis,might be relevant to considerwhen investing in the pro- tection and restoration ofaquatic ecosystems called for by the current EUwater policy and Biodiversity Strategy and by the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals},

Freshwater blooms result in economic losses of more than US{\$}4 billion annually in the United States alone, primarily from harm to aquatic food production, recreation and tourism, and drinking-water supplies3. Studies that document bloom conditions in lakes have either focused only on individual or regional subsets of lakes4–6, or have been limited by a lack of long-term observations7–9. Here we use three decades of high-resolution Landsat 5 satellite imagery to investigate long-term trends in intense summertime near-surface phytoplankton blooms for 71 large lakes globally. We find that peak summertime bloom intensity has increased in most (68 per cent) of the lakes studied, revealing a global exacerbation of bloom conditions. Lakes that have experienced a significant (P {\textless} 0.1) decrease in bloom intensity are rare (8 per cent). The reason behind the increase in phytoplankton bloom intensity remains unclear, however, as temporal trends do not track consistently with temperature, precipitation, fertilizer-use trends or other previously hypothesized drivers. We do find, however, that lakes with a decrease in bloom intensity warmed less compared to other lakes, suggesting that lake warming may already be counteracting management efforts to ameliorate eutrophication10,11. Our findings support calls for water quality management efforts to better account for the interactions between climate change and local hydrological conditions12,13.},

  abstract        = {Freshwater ecosystems are among the most diverse and dynamic ecosystems on Earth. At the same time, they are among the most threatened ecosystems but remain underrepresented in biodiversity research and conservation efforts. The rate of decline of vertebrate populations is much higher in freshwaters than in terrestrial or marine realms. Freshwater megafauna (i.e., freshwater animals that can reach a body mass ≥30 kg) are intrinsically prone to extinction due to their large body size, complex habitat requirements and slow life-history strategies such as long life span and late maturity. However, population trends and distribution changes of freshwater megafauna, at continental or global scales, remain unclear. In the present study, we compiled population data of 126 freshwater megafauna species globally from the Living Planet Database and available literature, and distribution data of 44 species inhabiting Europe and the United States from literature and databases of the International Union for Conservation of Nature and NatureServe. We quantified changes in population abundance and distribution range of freshwater megafauna species. Globally, freshwater megafauna populations declined by 88{\%} from 1970 to 2012, with the highest declines in the Indomalaya and Palearctic realms (−99{\%} and −97{\%}, respectively). Among taxonomic groups, mega-fishes exhibited the greatest global decline (−94{\%}). In addition, freshwater megafauna experienced major range contractions. For example, distribution ranges of 42{\%} of all freshwater megafauna species in Europe contracted by more than 40{\%} of historical areas. We highlight the various sources of uncertainty in tracking changes in populations and distributions of freshwater megafauna, such as the lack of monitoring data and taxonomic and spatial biases. The detected trends emphasize the critical plight of freshwater megafauna globally and highlight the broader need for concerted, targeted and timely conservation of freshwater biodiversity.},

  abstract        = {Aquatic species living in running waters are widely acknowledged to be vulnerable to climate-induced, thermal and hydrological fluctuations. Climate changes can interact with other environmental changes to determine structural and functional attributes of communities. Although such complex interactions are most likely to occur in a multiple-stressor context as frequently encountered in large rivers, they have received little attention in such ecosystems. In this study, we aimed at specifically addressing the issue of relative long-term effects of global and local changes on benthic macroinvertebrate communities in multistressed large rivers. We assessed effects of hydroclimatic vs. water quality factors on invertebrate community structure and composition over 30 years (1979-2008) in the Middle Loire River, France. As observed in other large European rivers, water warming over the three decades (+0.9 °C between 1979-1988 and 1999-2008) and to a lesser extent discharge reduction (-80 m3 s-1) were significantly involved in the disappearance or decrease in taxa typical from fast running, cold waters (e.g. Chloroperlidae and Potamanthidae). They explained also a major part of the appearance and increase of taxa typical from slow flowing or standing waters and warmer temperatures, including invasive species (e.g. Corbicula sp. and Atyaephyra desmarestii). However, this shift towards a generalist and pollution tolerant assemblage was partially confounded by local improvement in water quality (i.e. phosphate input reduction by about two thirds and eutrophication limitation by almost one half), explaining a significant part of the settlement of new pollution-sensitive taxa (e.g. the caddisfly Brachycentridae and Philopotamidae families) during the last years of the study period. The regain in such taxa allowed maintaining a certain level of specialization in the invertebrate community despite climate change effects. {\textcopyright} 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

Here, we present and analyse trends in the UK distributions of over 5,000 species of invertebrates, bryophytes and lichens, measured as changes in occupancy. Our results reveal substantial variation in the magnitude, direction and timing of changes over the last 45 years. Just one of the four major groups analysed, terrestrial non-insect invertebrates, exhibits the declining trend reported among vertebrates and butterflies. Both terrestrial insects and the bryophytes and lichens group increased in average occupancy. A striking pattern is found among freshwater species, which have undergone a strong recovery since the mid-1990s after two decades of decline. We show that, while average occupancy among most groups appears to have been stable or increasing, there has been substantial change in the relative commonness and rarity of individual species, indicating considerable turnover in community composition. Additionally, large numbers of species have experienced substantial declines. Our results suggest a more complex pattern of biodiversity change in the United Kingdom than previously reported.},

  abstract      = {Freshwater biodiversity is the over-riding conservation priority during the International Decade for Action - 'Water for Life' - 2005 to 2015. Fresh water makes up only 0.01{\%} of the World's water and approximately 0.8{\%} of the Earth's surface, yet this tiny fraction of global water supports at least 100000 species out of approximately 1.8 million - almost 6{\%} of all described species. Inland waters and freshwater biodiversity constitute a valuable natural resource, in economic, cultural, aesthetic, scientific and educational terms. Their conservation and management are critical to the interests of all humans, nations and governments. Yet this precious heritage is in crisis. Fresh waters are experiencing declines in biodiversity far greater than those in the most affected terrestrial ecosystems, and if trends in human demands for water remain unaltered and species losses continue at current rates, the opportunity to conserve much of the remaining biodiversity in fresh water will vanish before the 'Water for Life' decade ends in 2015. Why is this so, and what is being done about it? This article explores the special features of freshwater habitats and the biodiversity they support that makes them especially vulnerable to human activities. We document threats to global freshwater biodiversity under five headings: overexploitation; water pollution; flow modification; destruction or degradation of habitat; and invasion by exotic species. Their combined and interacting influences have resulted in population declines and range reduction of freshwater biodiversity worldwide. Conservation of biodiversity is complicated by the landscape position of rivers and wetlands as 'receivers' of land-use effluents, and the problems posed by endemism and thus non-substitutability. In addition, in many parts of the world, fresh water is subject to severe competition among multiple human stakeholders. Protection of freshwater biodiversity is perhaps the ultimate conservation challenge because it is influenced by the upstream drainage network, the surrounding land, the riparian zone, and - in the case of migrating aquatic fauna - downstream reaches. Such prerequisites are hardly ever met. Immediate action is needed where opportunities exist to set aside intact lake and river ecosystems within large protected areas. For most of the global land surface, trade-offs between conservation of freshwater biodiversity and human use of ecosystem goods and services are necessary. We advocate continuing attempts to check species loss but, in many situations, urge adoption of a compromise position of management for biodiversity conservation, ecosystem functioning and resilience, and human livelihoods in order to provide a viable long-term basis for freshwater conservation. Recognition of this need will require adoption of a new paradigm for biodiversity protection and freshwater ecosystem management - one that has been appropriately termed 'reconciliation ecology'.},

Which classification methods are most effective according to classification validity evaluators? How do evaluators with different optimality criteria differ in their assessments of classification efficacy? In particular, do evaluators which use geometric criteria (e.g. cluster compactness) and non-geometric evaluators (which rely on diagnostic species) offer similar classification evaluations? Methods: We analysed classifications of two vegetation data-sets produced by eight classification methods. Classification solutions were assessed with five geometric and four non-geometric internal evaluators. We formally introduce three new evaluators: PARTANA, an intuitive variation on evaluators which use the ratio of within/between cluster dissimilarity as the optimality criterion, an adaptation of Morisita's index of niche overlap, and ISAMIC, an algorithm which measures the degree to which species are either always present or always absent within clusters. Results and Conclusions: 1. With the exception of single linkage hierarchical clustering, classifications resulting from the eight methods were often similar. 2. Although evaluators varied in their assessment of best overall classification method, they generally favored three hierarchical agglomerative clustering strategies: flexible beta ($\beta$ = - 0.25), average linkage, and Ward's linkage. 3. Among introduced evaluators PARTANA appears to be an effective geometric strategy which provides assessments similar to C-index and Gamma evaluators. Non-geometric evaluators ISAMIC and Morisita's index demonstrate a strong bias for single linkage solutions. 4. Because non-geometric criteria are of interest to phytosociologists there is a strong need for their continued development for use with vegetation classifications.},

  abstract        = {1. Mass effect, allowing species to persist in unfavourable habitats, and dispersal limitation, preventing species from reaching favourable habitats, are the two major dispersal processes. While dispersal limitation can be detected by experimental or modelling techniques, mass effect is more challenging to evaluate, which hampers our ability to disentangle the influence of the environment vs. dispersal on species distribution. This is undesirable for biomonitoring programmes built on known species‐environment relationships. 2. We developed an approach for detection of species influenced by mass effect. We tested it on stream diatoms, a widely used taxonomic group for stream biomonitoring, from four French watersheds. This approach combined (1) an appropriate spatial framework, the Asymmetric Eigenvector Map (AEM), used in species distribution modelling to measure the relative influence of dispersal vs. niche processes, (2) an analysis of negative co‐occurrence patterns to separate mass effect from dispersal limitation, and (3) a measurement of niche breadths to distinguish between non‐spatially structured generalists and species influenced by mass effect. 3. We propose that species characterized by low negative co‐occurrence values, a high correlation to spatial factors and average to low niche breadths are sensitive to mass effect. 4. Synthesis and applications. We suggest that the sensitivity of species towards mass effect should represent a new ecological trait to be considered for fundamental and applied issues concerning ecology and water quality assessment. Almost all of the species identified here as influenced by mass effect are contributing to the calculation of different diatom‐based indices (e.g., Biological Diatom Index or Specific Pollution‐sensitivity Index) and should be treated with caution when assigning ecological status classes to water bodies.},

This dose increase can be directly measured with 0.1 mm thin sheets of graphite-loaded TLD's (LiF, Vinten). For Co-60 gamma rays a commercial amalgam filling caused a dose increase by a factor of 1.7. The half value layer for this additional radiation was measured to be approximately 0.4 mm tissue.

  abstract        = {The Water Framework Directive (WFD) is a pioneering piece of legislation that aims to protect and enhance aquatic ecosystems and promote sustainable water use across Europe. There is growing concern that the objective of good status, or higher, in all EU waters by 2027 is a long way from being achieved in many countries. Through questionnaire analysis of almost 100 experts, we provide recommendations to enhance WFD monitoring and assessment systems, improve programmes of measures and further integrate with other sectoral policies. Our analysis highlights that there is great potential to enhance assessment schemes through strategic design of monitoring networks and innovation, such as earth observation. New diagnostic tools that use existing WFD monitoring data, but incorporate novel statistical and trait-based approaches could be used more widely to diagnose the cause of deterioration under conditions of multiple pressures and deliver a hierarchy of solutions for more evidence-driven decisions in river basin management. There is also a growing recognition that measures undertaken in river basin management should deliver multiple benefits across sectors, such as reduced flood risk, and there needs to be robust demonstration studies that evaluate these. Continued efforts in ‘mainstreaming' water policy into other policy sectors is clearly needed to deliver wider success with WFD goals, particularly with agricultural policy. Other key policy areas where a need for stronger integration with water policy was recognised included urban planning (waste water treatment), flooding, climate and energy (hydropower). Having a deadline for attaining the policy objective of good status is important, but even more essential is to have a permanent framework for river basin management that addresses the delays in implementation of measures. This requires a long-term perspective, far beyond the current deadline of 2027.},

However, the achievement of common management objectives is jeopardised by different national quality targets and ambitions. The European Water Framework Directive requires that quality classifications are harmonised via an intercalibration exercise, ensuring a consistent level of ambition in the protection and restoration of surface water bodies across the Member States of the European Union. We outline the key principles of the intercalibration methodology, review the achievements of intercalibration and discuss its benefits and drawbacks. Less than half of the required intercalibration has been completed, mostly due to a lack of national assessment methods. The process has fostered a scientific debate on ecological classification with important implications for environmental management. Despite a significant level of statistical abstraction, intercalibration yielded a fundamental and unified vision of what constitutes good ecology across Europe, in principle ensuring greater parity in the funds invested to achieve good ecological status. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract  = {The capacity of ecosystems to supply ecosystem services is decreasing. Sustaining this supply requires an understanding of the links between the impacts of pressures introduced by human activities and how this can lead to changes in the supply of services. Here, we apply a novel approach, assessing ‘risk to ecosystem service supply' (RESS), across a range of aquatic ecosystems in seven case studies. We link aggregate impact risk from human activities on ecosystem components, with a relative score of their potential to supply services. The greatest RESS is found where an ecosystem component with a high potential to supply services is subject to high impact risk. In this context, we explore variability in RESS across 99 types of aquatic ecosystem component from 11 realms, ranging from oceanic to wetlands. We explore some causes of variability in the RESS observed, including assessment area, Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and population density. We found that Lakes, Rivers, Inlets and Coastal realms had some of the highest RESS, though this was highly dependent on location. We found a positive relationship between impact risk and service supply potential, indicating the ecosystem components we rely on most for services, are also those most at risk. However, variability in this relationship indicates that protecting the supply of ecosystem services alone will not protect all parts of the ecosystem at high risk. Broad socio-economic factors explained some of the variability found in RESS. For example, RESS was positively associated with GDP and artificial and agricultural land use in most realms, highlighting the need to achieve balance between increasing GDP and sustaining ecosystem health and human wellbeing more broadly. This approach can be used for sustainable management of ecosystem service use, to highlight the ecosystem components most critical to supplying services, and those most at risk.},

  abstract        = {The aim of European water policy is to achieve good ecological status in all rivers, lakes, coastal and transitional waters by 2027. Currently, more than half of water bodies are in a degraded condition and nutrient enrichment is one of the main culprits. Therefore, there is a pressing need to establish reliable and comparable nutrient criteria that are consistent with good ecological status. This paper highlights the wide range of nutrient criteria currently in use by Member States of the European Union to support good ecological status and goes on to suggest that inappropriate criteria may be hindering the achievement of good status. Along with a comprehensive overview of nutrient criteria, we provide a critical analysis of the threshold concentrations and approaches by which these are set. We identify four essential issues: (1) Different nutrients (nitrogen and/or phosphorus) are used for different water categories in different countries. (2) The use of different nutrient fractions (total, dissolved inorganic) and statistical summary metrics (e.g., mean, percentiles, seasonal, annual) currently hampers comparability between countries, particularly for rivers, transitional and coastal waters. (3) Wide ranges in nutrient threshold values within shared water body types, in some cases showing more than a 10-fold difference in concentrations. (4) Different approaches used to set threshold nutrient concentrations to define the boundary between “good” and “moderate” ecological status. Expert judgement-based methods resulted in significantly higher (less stringent) good-moderate threshold values compared with data-driven approaches, highlighting the importance of consistent and rigorous approaches to criteria setting. We suggest that further development of nutrient criteria should be based on relationships between ecological status and nutrient concentrations, taking into account the need for comparability between different water categories, water body types within these categories, and countries.},

  abstract        = {Projected climate and environmental change are expected to increase the pressure on global freshwater resources. To prepare for and cope with the related risks, stakeholders need to devise plans for sustainable management of river systems, which in turn requires the identification of management appropriate operational units, such as groups of rivers that share similar environmental and biological characteristics. Ideally, these units are of a manageable size, and are biotically or abiotically distinguishable across a variety of river types. Here, we aim to address this need by presenting a new global river classification framework (GloRiC) to establish a common vocabulary and standardized approach to the development of globally comprehensive and integrated river classifications that can be tailored to different goals and requirements. We define the GloRiC conceptual framework based on five categories of variables: (1) hydrology; (2) physiography and climate; (3) fluvial geomorphology; (4) water chemistry; and (5) aquatic biology. We then apply the framework using hydro-environmental attributes provided by a seamless high-resolution river reach database to create initial instances of three sub-classifications (hydrologic, physio-climatic, and geomorphic) which we ultimately combine into 127 river reach types at the global scale. These supervised classifications utilize a mix of statistical analyses and expert interpretation to identify the classifier variables, the number of classes, and their thresholds. In addition, we also present an unsupervised, multivariable k-means statistical clustering of all river reaches into 30 groups. These first-of-their-kind global river reach classifications at high spatial resolution provide baseline information for a total of 35.9 million kilometers of rivers that have been assessed in this study, and are expected to be particularly useful in remote or data-poor river basins. The GloRiC framework and associated data are primarily designed for broad and rapid applicability in assessments that require stratified analyses of river ecosystem conditions at global and regional scales; smaller-scale applications could follow the same conceptual framework yet use more detailed data sources.},

The test follows a stepwise filtering process involving various numerical-classification tools. Five steps were involved in the testing: (1) evaluation of 322 classification tools using Optim-Class 1; (2) comparison of 20 best performing methods by standardising the various performances across a range of fidelity values using OptimClass 1 and OptimClass 2, to assess the effectiveness of the agglomerative clustering and one divisive technique; (3) calculation and comparison of Uniqueness values and ISAMIC (Indicator Species Analysis Minimising Intermediate Constancies) scores of the resulting classifications; (4) comparison of different classifications by analysing the similarities of the resulting synoptic tables using faithful species, assuming that clusters with similar faithful species represent corresponding vegetation types, and (5) final selection of the single best method based on an expert review of non-geometric internal evaluators, NMDS ordinations and mapped classification solutions. A complex data set, representing many forest vegetation types and consisting of 506 relev{\'{e}}s of 20 m × 20 m sampled in the indigenous forests of Mpumalanga Province (South Africa), was tested. Analysis of Uniqueness provided insight into which methods produced classifications that did not share faithful species. The analysis of synoptic table similarity showed that the classification results were at most 88{\%} similar, while in the most divergent case similarity of only 50{\%} was achieved. OptimClass eliminated poorly performing numerical- classification combinations and highlighted the best performing methods. Yet it was unable to reveal the single best performing method unequivocally across the range of fidelity values used. In such cases, we suggest the solution can be sought in relying on involving external data through expert opinion. Ordinal Clustering and TWINSPAN produced the most outlying classification results. Flexible beta clustering ($\beta$= -0.25) in combination with Bray-Curtis coefficient, standardised by sample unit totals, produced the most informative result for our data set when using informal expert-defined ecological and biogeographical judgement criteria. We recommend that the performance of a set of methods be tested prior to selecting the final classification approach.},

  abstract        = {This paper presents two new non-hierarchical iterative reallocation optimization algorithms for vegetation classification. The OPTimal PARTitioning algorithm (OPTPART) optimizes the ratio of within-cluster similarity to among-cluster similarity; the OPTimal SILhouette algorithm (OPTSIL) optimizes the difference between the similarity of each sample to the cluster to which it is assigned and its similarity to the most similar cluster. The algorithms were tested on three vegetation datasets (Mt. Field Massif, Tazmania, Australia; Podyj/Thayatal National Park, Austria/Czech Republic; and Shoshone National Forest, Wyoming, USA) using three dissimilarity/distance matrices (Bray-Curtis, chord distance, and Hellinger distance) and compared to five other commonly used or recently introduced vegetation classification algorithms (flexible-$\beta$, TWINSPAN, PAM, ISOPAM, and K-means) using eight goodness-of-clustering evaluators. Five of the eight evaluators were species-based and operate on the distribution of individual taxa among clusters; three were community-based and operate on the compositional similarity of clusters. OPTPART was initialized from random partitions and from the results of a flexible-$\beta$ classification as the initial partition; OPTSIL was initialized from partitions resulting from OPTPART, flexible-$\beta$, and K-means classifications. Algorithms were ranked from best to worst on each clustering evaluator for each dissimilarity/distance matrix for each dataset, and summarized by median ranks. OPTPART, SIL/OPT (OPTSIL from an OPTPART initial partition), and SIL/FLEX (OPTSIL from a flexible-$\beta$ initial partition) ranked 1–3 respectively for results pooled across all three datasets and dissimilarity/distance matrices. OPTPART, SIL/OPT, and SIL/FLEX consistently ranked 1–3 across the individual datasets, although the order varied slightly by dataset.},

  abstract        = {Classification of waterbodies is a necessary step for aquatic biological assessment. Geographic classes, such as physiographic provinces, marine biogeographic provinces, and ecoregions are frequently used as a classification framework for conducting bioassessments. An alternative to such a priori classification of waterbodies is to let the biological data tell us, using various statistical exploratory techniques to identify classes that do not necessarily conform to geographic stratification. In assessment of new sites, it is often necessary to identify or predict which of several classes the new site may belong to. We classified benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages from streams of Wyoming, using 3 alternative methods: a priori establishment of ecoregions, adaptive modification of the ecoregions, and a posteriori clustering. Classification strengths were compared using similarity dendrograms. Clustering separated the sites better than ecoregions, but the clusters showed strong ecoregional affinities. The modified ecoregions were equal to the clusters in classification strength. We conclude that an iterative process that includes generation of hypotheses, exploratory data analysis, and evaluation and modification of hypotheses is most likely to produce robust classifications, regardless of specific analytical approaches used.},

  abstract        = {The usefulness of ecoregions and catchments (hydrologic units) as bases for classifying aquatic vertebrate assemblages in western Oregon was compared using samples collected by electrofishing from 137 wadeable stream sites distributed evenly throughout the region. The classification strengths of these regionalizations were also compared with neutral-model classifications that were based either on intersite proximities in geographic distance or on intersite similarities in the sampled vertebrate assemblages. The strength of each classification was assessed by the extent to which average within-class assemblage similarities exceeded the average similarity between classes. Mean similarity dendrograms were used as a concise graphical comparison of between- and within-class similarities for alternative classifications, whether they were specified a priori or constructed by clustering. For each a priori classification, a permutation test of the no class structure hypothesis was performed. Classification strengths were assessed using the Sorenson - Dice (presence/absence) and Bray - Curtis (relative abundance) similarity measures, applied to both species-level and family-level assemblage characterizations, as well as for the Bray - Curtis measure applied to a set of 5 assemblage metrics that were designed to reflect stream impairment. For all 5 measures of assemblage similarity, ecoregions had higher classification strengths than did large catchments, and large catchments had about the same strength as a stream-order classification. A catchment classification with 1 of the 3 catchments split into 2 ecoregions separated assemblages as strongly as ecoregions alone. A neutral-model classification based solely on geographic site proximity classified assemblages with about the same strength as ecoregions. Another neutral-model classification of sites, based solely on their sampled assemblages, was at least twice as strong as any of the geographic classifications. Intermediate strength was seen in site groupings derived from a composite measure of between-site assemblage and geographic dissimilarities. Our results suggest that ecoregions and large catchments do indeed have utility for classifying stream vertebrate assemblages. However, much of their classification strength may be a result of spatial autocorrelation effects, rather than ecological factors that determine their particular boundaries. Our similarity analyses also suggest that geographic partitions can be expected to account for only a minor portion of the total variation seen in stream vertebrate assemblages across a large region.},

The dendrograms offer a concise picture of the overall strength of a classification as well as the compactness and isolation of individual classes. Although broadly applicable, the dendrograms were motivated by a need for easily communicated assessments of land classifications that are intended to serve as geographic frameworks for environmental research and management. The dendrograms and other similarity-based tools are applied to a single-factor classification of fish communities sampled along a 281-km section of the Willamette River in the state of Oregon (U.S.). In a second example, the tools are used to evaluate a two-factor classification of fish communities sampled in wadeable streams of Oregon's Cascade Mountains and Willamette Valley. The dendrograms help to assess the relative classification strengths of the two factors, factor interactions, and an alternative classification derived from cluster analysis},

  abstract  = {More than 500 controlled experiments have collectively suggested that biodiversity loss reduces ecosystem productivity and stability. Yet the importance of biodiversity in sustaining the world's ecosystems remains controversial, largely because of the lack of validation in nature, where strong abiotic forcing and complex interactions are assumed to swamp biodiversity effects. Here we test this assumption by analysing 133 estimates reported in 67 field studies that statistically separated the effects of biodiversity on biomass production from those of abiotic forcing. Contrary to the prevailing opinion of the previous two decades that biodiversity would have rare or weak effects in nature, we show that biomass production increases with species richness in a wide range of wild taxa and ecosystems. In fact, after controlling for environmental covariates, increases in biomass with biodiversity are stronger in nature than has previously been documented in experiments and comparable to or stronger than the effects of other well-known drivers of productivity, including climate and nutrient availability. These results are consistent with the collective experimental evidence that species richness increases community biomass production, and suggest that the role of biodiversity in maintaining productive ecosystems should figure prominently in global change science and policy.},

Besides increasing average temperatures, many studies predict greater temperature extremes and intense precipitation events as a consequence of climate change. In this study we examined long-term observation data (10–32 years) of 26 streams and rivers from four ecoregions in the European Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) network, to investigate invertebrate community responses to changing climatic conditions. We used functional trait and multi-taxonomic analyses and combined examinations of general long-term changes in communities with detailed analyses of the impact of different climatic drivers (i.e., various temperature and precipitation variables) by focusing on the response of communities to climatic conditions of the previous year. Taxa and ecoregions differed substantially in their response to climate change conditions. We did not observe any trend of changes in total taxonomic richness or overall abundance over time or with increasing temperatures, which reflects a compensatory turnover in the composition of communities; sensitive Plecoptera decreased in response to warmer years and Ephemeroptera increased in northern regions. Invasive species increased with an increasing number of extreme days which also caused an apparent upstream community movement. The observed changes in functional feeding group diversity indicate that climate change may be associated with changes in trophic interactions within aquatic food webs. These findings highlight the vulnerability of riverine ecosystems to climate change and emphasize the need to further explore the interactive effects of climate change variables with other local stressors to develop appropriate conservation measures.},

While tendencies towards taxonomic homogenization in biological communities have been extensively studied, functional homogenization remains an understudied facet of biodiversity. Here, we tested four hypotheses related to long-term changes (1991–2016) in the taxonomic and functional arrangement of freshwater macroinvertebrate assemblages across space and possible drivers of these changes. Using data collected annually at 64 river sites in mainland New Zealand, we related temporal changes in taxonomic and functional spatial $\beta$-diversity, and the contribution of individual sites to $\beta$-diversity, to a set of global, regional, catchment and reach-scale environmental descriptors. We observed long-term, mostly climate-induced, temporal trends towards taxonomic homogenization but functional differentiation among macroinvertebrate assemblages. These changes were mainly driven by replacements of species and functional traits among assemblages, rather than nested species loss. In addition, there was no difference between the mean rate of change in the taxonomic and functional facets of $\beta$-diversity. Climatic processes governed overall population and community changes in these freshwater ecosystems, but were amplified by multiple anthropogenic, topographic and biotic drivers of environmental change, acting widely across the landscape. The functional diversification of communities could potentially provide communities with greater stability, resistance and resilience capacity to environmental change, despite ongoing taxonomic homogenization. Therefore, our study highlights a need to further understand temporal trajectories in both taxonomic and functional components of species communities, which could enable a clearer picture of how biodiversity and ecosystems will respond to future global changes.},

  abstract        = {According to the Water Framework Directive (WFD), the status of European surface waters is assessed using aquatic organism groups. Here we present an overview of 297 assessment methods, based on a questionnaire survey addressing authorities in all countries implementing the WFD. Twenty-eight countries reported on methods applied to rivers (30{\%}), coastal waters (26{\%}), lakes (25{\%}) and transitional waters (19{\%}). More than half of the methods are based on macroscopic plants (28{\%}) or benthic invertebrates (26{\%}); in addition, phytoplankton (21{\%}), fish (15{\%}) and phytobenthos (10{\%}) were assessed. Countries of Central and Western Europe had developed almost all methods required for the WFD implementation. Two main sampling strategies were discernable: small-scale sampling of the taxonomically diverse groups of benthic invertebrates and phytobenthos that demand elaborate processing, versus large-scale sampling of vast, species-poor plant stands or the mobile fish fauna. About three-quarters of methods identified organisms to species-level while in particular phytoplankton-based methods used class- or phylum-level, or included no taxonomic information. Out of nine metric types distinguished, river methods used more sensitivity and trait metrics while for other water categories abundance metrics prevailed. Fish-based methods showed the highest number of metrics. Fifty-six percent of methods focussed on the detection of eutrophication and organic pollution, with shares decreasing from autotrophic to heterotrophic organism groups: phytoplankton {\textgreater} phytobenthos {\textgreater} macroscopic plants {\textgreater} benthic invertebrates {\textgreater} fish fauna. The order was almost reverse for hydrological or morphological deterioration: fish fauna and macroscopic plants {\textgreater} benthic invertebrates {\textgreater} phytoplankton {\textgreater} phytobenthos. These pressures were mainly assessed by methods applied to rivers and transitional waters. The pressure-impact relationship of about one-third of methods was not tested empirically with methods for transitional waters being the least validated. The strength of relationships differed significantly between organism groups and water categories. The correlation coefficients generally covered a broad range ({\textless}0.4 to {\textgreater}0.8), but on average with the pattern: phytoplankton {\textgreater} macroscopic plants {\textgreater} benthic invertebrates {\textgreater} phytobenthos and fish fauna. In terms of water categories the following order resulted: coastal waters {\textgreater} lakes {\textgreater} transitional waters {\textgreater} rivers. Status boundaries were mostly defined using statistical approaches. We advocate better reflection of the necessary sampling effort and precision, full validations of pressure-impact relationships and an implementation of more ecological components into classification. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

  title    = {{Broad typology for rivers and lakes in Europe for large scale analysis}},
  year     = {2019},
  abstract = {Typology of waters is defined as a group of water bodies having common natural ecological conditions in terms of geo-morphological, hydrological, physico-chemical, and biological characteristics. The type descriptors are permanent characteristics that do not respond to human activities and represent the fixed abiotic conditions that explain natural variability. For the need of large-scale analysis of ecological status, multiple pressures on rivers and lakes, linkages of water body types to habitat types and for comparison of type-specific limit values for nutrients and other quality elements across countries in Europe, a broad river and lake typology was developed. Descriptors categories are dominant geology, region, river catchment, river altitude, river flow, lake size and mean lake depth. The ranges of descriptors largely follow the system A of Water Framework Directive (WFD) (EC, 2000) and are described in Lyche Solheim et al. (2019).\\
 \\
Various European data sources were used for spatial allocation of rivers and lakes broad types. The starting point was the European Catchments and Rivers Network System (Ecrins) (EEA, 2012), which is organised into sets of spatial thematic layers: lake polygons, river segments (drains), nodes representing intersection of river and catchments and almost 180,000 {\textquotedblleft}Functional Elementary Catchments (FECs){\textquotedblright}. Catchments include {\textquotedblleft}main drains{\textquotedblright} (connecting together the FECs) and {\textquotedblleft}secondary drains{\textquotedblright} (internal within a FEC). We assigned one broad type to all segments belonging to {\textquotedblleft}main drain{\textquotedblright} of each FEC and named them {\textquotedblleft}river segment".\\
\\
The catchment size of river segments in each FEC is defined as the sum of the upstream drainage area and FEC surface area. The upstream drainage area has been derived using data in {\textquotedblleft}Code Arbo{\textquotedblright} in Ecrins database (Globevnik et al., 2017). The altitude of the lower end points of river segments in each FEC is available in Ecrins river database. Lake surface area is obtained from Ecrins lake area attribute {\textquotedblleft}Area{\textquotedblright}. Data on mean lake depth were obtained from Waterbase {\textendash} Water Quality database (EEA, 2016) or estimated from terrain data. The basic map of five geological (geochemical) categories was produced from two thematic maps: bedrock map {\textquotedblleft}International Hydrogeological Map of Europe (IHME 1500$\_$v11){\textquotedblright} (Dutcher et al, 2015) and the soil map of the European Union {\textquotedblleft}SGDBE4{\textquotedblright} (JRC, 2016). The dominant geology for lakes was derived from this map with the overlay procedure. For each FEC we then defined dominant catchment geology (geochemistry) and assigned this geology type to all river segments forming the FEC{\textquotesingle}s main drain. Spatial extent of the Mediterranean region is obtained from spatial layer {\textquotesingle}Biogeographical regions of Europe{\guillemotright} (EEA, 2019). More details on methodology are in Lyche Solheim et al. (2019).},

  abstract        = {Cluster analysis plays vital role in pattern recognition in several fields of science. Silhouette width is a widely used index for assessing the fit of individual objects in the classification, as well as the quality of clusters and the entire classification. Silhouette combines two clustering criteria, compactness and separation, which imply that spherical cluster shapes are preferred over others—a property that can be seen as a disadvantage in the presence of complex, nonspherical clusters, which is common in real situations. We suggest a generalization of the silhouette width using the generalized mean. By changing the p parameter of the generalized mean between −∞ and +∞, several specific summary statistics, including the minimum, maximum, the arithmetic, harmonic, and geometric means, can be reproduced. Implementing the generalized mean in the calculation of silhouette width allows for changing the sensitivity of the index to compactness versus connectedness. With higher sensitivity to connectedness, the preference of silhouette width toward spherical clusters should reduce. We test the performance of the generalized silhouette width on artificial data sets and on the Iris data set. We examine how classifications with different numbers of clusters prepared by different algorithms are evaluated, if p is set to different values. When p was negative, well-separated clusters achieved high silhouette widths despite their elongated or circular shapes. Positive values of p increased the importance of compactness; hence, the preference toward spherical clusters became even more detectable. With low p, single linkage clustering was deemed the most efficient clustering method, while with higher parameter values the performance of group average, complete linkage, and beta flexible with beta = −0.25 seemed better. The generalized silhouette allows for adjusting the contribution of compactness and connectedness criteria, thus avoiding underestimation of clustering efficiency in the presence of clusters with high internal heterogeneity.},

  abstract      = {Metacommunity ecology addresses the situation where sets of local communities are connected by the dispersal of a number of potentially interacting species. Aquatic systems (e.g. lentic versus lotic versus marine) differ from each other in connectivity and environmental heterogeneity, suggesting that metacommunity organisation also differs between major aquatic systems. Here, we review findings from observational field studies on metacommunity organisation in aquatic systems. Species sorting (i.e. species are 'filtered' by environmental factors and occur only at environmentally suitable sites) prevails in aquatic systems, particularly in streams and lakes, but the degree to which dispersal limitation interacts with such environmental control varies among different systems and spatial scales. For example, mainstem rivers and marine coastal systems may be strongly affected by 'mass effects' (i.e. where high dispersal rates homogenise communities to some degree at neighbouring localities, irrespective of their abiotic and biotic environmental conditions), whereas isolated lakes and ponds may be structured by dispersal limitation (i.e. some species do not occur at otherwise-suitable localities simply because sites with potential colonists are too far away). Flow directionality in running waters also differs from water movements in other systems, and this difference may also have effects on the role of dispersal in different aquatic systems. Dispersal limitation typically increases with increasing spatial distance between sites, mass effects potentially increase in importance with decreasing distance between sites, and the dispersal ability of organisms may determine the spatial extents at which species sorting and dispersal processes are most important. A better understanding of the relative roles of species sorting, mass effects and dispersal limitation in affecting aquatic metacommunities requires the following: (i) characterising dispersal rates more directly or adopting better proxies than have been used previously; (ii) considering the nature of aquatic networks; (iii) combining correlative and experimental approaches; (iv) exploring temporal aspects of metacommunity organisation and (v) applying past approaches and statistical methods innovatively for increasing our understanding of metacommunity organisation.},

  abstract      = {Predicting which species will occur together in the future, and where, remains one of the greatest challenges in ecology, and requires a sound understanding of how the abiotic and biotic environments interact with dispersal processes and history across scales. Biotic interactions and their dynamics influence species' relationships to climate, and this also has important implications for predicting future distributions of species. It is already well accepted that biotic interactions shape species' spatial distributions at local spatial extents, but the role of these interactions beyond local extents (e.g. 10 km(2) to global extents) are usually dismissed as unimportant. In this review we consolidate evidence for how biotic interactions shape species distributions beyond local extents and review methods for integrating biotic interactions into species distribution modelling tools. Drawing upon evidence from contemporary and palaeoecological studies of individual species ranges, functional groups, and species richness patterns, we show that biotic interactions have clearly left their mark on species distributions and realised assemblages of species across all spatial extents. We demonstrate this with examples from within and across trophic groups. A range of species distribution modelling tools is available to quantify species environmental relationships and predict species occurrence, such as: (i) integrating pairwise dependencies, (ii) using integrative predictors, and (iii) hybridising species distribution models (SDMs) with dynamic models. These methods have typically only been applied to interacting pairs of species at a single time, require a priori ecological knowledge about which species interact, and due to data paucity must assume that biotic interactions are constant in space and time. To better inform the future development of these models across spatial scales, we call for accelerated collection of spatially and temporally explicit species data. Ideally, these data should be sampled to reflect variation in the underlying environment across large spatial extents, and at fine spatial resolution. Simplified ecosystems where there are relatively few interacting species and sometimes a wealth of existing ecosystem monitoring data (e.g. arctic, alpine or island habitats) offer settings where the development of modelling tools that account for biotic interactions may be less difficult than elsewhere.},

Additionally, we evaluated the effects of taxonomic resolution and data type (abundance and presence) on results. Methods: Five stream classification systems were used, two based on hydroregions, one based on ecoregions by FEOW, a fourth one based on stream orders and the last one based on clusters of environment variables sampled in 37 streams at Rio Grande do Sul state, Brazil. We used a randomization test to evaluate differences of richness and abundance, a db-MANOVA to evaluate the differences of species assemblages and Classification Strength (CS) to evaluate the classifications performance. Results: There were differences of richness and abundance among stream classes within each stream classification. The same result was found for community data, except for stream order classifications in family level. We observed that stream classes obtained for each stream classification differed in terms of environment variables (db-MANOVA). The classification based on environment variables showed higher CS values than other classification systems. The taxonomic resolution was important to the observed results. Data on genera level presented CS values 12% higher than family level for cluster classification, and the data type was dependent on the classification system and taxonomic resolution employed. Conclusion: Our results indicate that classifications based on cluster of environment variables was better than other stream classification systems, and similar results using genera level can be obtained for management programs using family resolution in a geographical context similar to this study.},

  abstract        = {Landscape classifications are increasingly being used in conservation planning and biodiversity management, although there is a dearth of studies actually showing concordant patterns between such classifications and biodiversity. We studied the utility of tributary and stream type classifications in accounting for the variability of invertebrate biodiversity in a boreal drainage system. We found that only weak, although significant, differences existed between the studied three tributaries and four stream types in macroinvertebrate assemblage structure, species distributions, and taxonomic richness. Further, the classification strengths, calculated as mean within-group-similarity minus mean between-group-similarity of assemblage structure, were rather low, suggesting that the a priori physical classifications did not effectively describe variability in macroinvertebrate assemblage structure. The low classification strengths likely resulted from the facts that: (i) most stream macroinvertebrate taxa show individualistic responses to environmental gradients; (ii) many taxa occur either across all stream types; or (iii) only sporadically in a given stream type; and (iv) only a few species show high fidelity to a given stream type. However, the significance of the differences in macroinvertebrate assemblage structure and taxonomic richness, as well as a bunch of effective indicator species for different stream types, suggest that such classifications could be used as a preliminary scheme for the conservation planning of running waters. This reasoning is also supported by the evidence from other studies that have found stream size and the distance to upstream lakes to shape considerably the biodiversity of various groups of stream organisms, although no single organism group is likely to show a perfect match with any classification scheme. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {The ecological quality of river habitats is increasingly assessed using multiple taxonomic groups. As widely recognised, assessments should be based on the reference condition approach where potentially impaired sites are compared to pristine or near pristine reference sites. To enable valid comparisons, natural variability of habitat characteristics and biotic assemblages should be controlled for, by using either an a priori river typology as suggested by the European Union Water Framework Directive (WFD) or by some other reference framework. We examined a simple WFD river typology, based on two broad-scale ecoregions, catchment area, and geology, as a basis for reference conditions of macroinvertebrates and diatoms in Finland. The ability of this a priori typology to account for natural variation in assemblage composition was evaluated by comparing it with null models (no typology) and with a posteriori clusters ('optimal' biological typology). The biological clusters were clearly more effective than the WFD typology in partitioning assemblage variation for diatoms, whereas differences among the groupings were less evident for macroinvertebrates. Similarly, the number of observed versus expected typespecific taxa (O/E-ratio) was more precise with the a posteriori clusters than with the WFD typology for diatoms, while there were no clear differences among the groupings for macroinvertebrates. For diatoms, the typology was virtually inefficient in improving the precision of O/E from that of the null model. Strong biogeographical patterns in assemblage composition of both biotic groups were evident between and within the two ecoregions. Variation in macroinvertebrate assemblages was primarily related to geographical location and river size, whereas geographical location and water chemistry were the most important environmental factors for diatoms. Our results suggest that simple a priori typologies could be used as a framework for reference condition in freshwater bioassessment. However, when assessments are conducted using multiple taxonomic groups, typologies should be based on factors important for each individual group. {\textcopyright} 2009 E.

Second, most of Europe's very large rivers have been severely altered by human activities such as flood protection, damming and navigation. The aim of our study is to develop an assessment method for very large rivers by identifying suitable biological metrics as the basis for multi-metric bioassessment using benthic invertebrates. Based on the pan-European typology of very large rivers by Borgwardt et al. (2019), we established a river type-specific assessment approach using invertebrate samples from 25 European countries and 94 very large rivers. The frequency and intensity of eight pressures jointly acting on the sampling sites were described, and a selection of suitable invertebrate community metrics were correlated with the pressure intensities to establish pressure-response relationships. The very large river types differ in terms of relevant pressures and pressure combinations, with the invertebrate communities distinctly responding to these pressure patterns. Neozoa dominance correlated strongly with ‘navigation’, being a major pressure at very large rivers, which entails severe hydro-morphological alterations such as channelization, riparian vegetation alteration and impoundment. Under combined pressures, a critical community turnover became evident in terms of neozoa outnumbering EPT taxa and the ratio of hemilimnic invertebrates decreasing. We propose ten bioassessment metrics, including measures of biological diversity as well as newly generated indicators, for the development of a European type-specific assessment method for very large rivers.},

  abstract      = {The present work aims to analyze the spatio-temporal variability in benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages and biotic indices in an undisturbed and unpolluted Pyrenean river. Samples were collected seasonally over 2 year-cycles (2001-2002) at fifteen sampling sites along the Erro River (Ebro River Basin, Spain) during a exhaustive biomonitoring program following the IBMWP-IASPT scoring system protocol routinely applied in Iberia. Despite absolute values of the biotic indices showed high spatio-temporal variation, the IBMWP-IASPT scoring system proved useful because water quality classes were consistent throughout seasons and years as well as along-river. The original macroinvertebrate families' presence/absence data matrix was reduced in a number of ways to conduct different statistical procedures in order to detect and separate the underlying near-natural spatial and temporal gradients of the assemblage composition in the Erro River. Along-river, spatial variation of the macroinvertebrate community composition was well assessed by similarity analysis, which clearly detected physical features on the river (drought-affected reach, gorge, towns and flow gauging weirs). Categorical principal component analysis (CATPCA) synthesized and jointly ordered macroinvertebrate samples in a spatio-temporal gradient in the factorial map defined by the first two principal components providing a parsimonious way to assess the assemblages' variation. These two variation gradients throughout the macroinvertebrate families' occurrence data were subsequently confirmed separately by several correspondence analyses and revealed additional information, as the representative families for each sampling site group and season could be identified. Furthermore, these spatio-temporal gradients were discussed and put in relation with changes in the aquatic habitat (water temperature, conductivity, total dissolved solids, water velocity, channel width, canopy cover, etc.). The near-natural functioning of the Erro River promoted us to emphasize that conservation efforts should aim to maintain the free-flowing as a permanent source of variability. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {For the European Parliament and Commission to implement the Water Framework Directive (WFD), the water-quality indices that are currently used in Europe need to be compared and calibrated. This will facilitate the comparative assessment of ecological status throughout the European Union. According to the WFD, biologic indices should respond consistently to human impacts, using multimetric approaches and water-quality classification boundaries adjusted to a common set of normative definitions. The European Commission has started an intercalibration exercise to review biologic indices and harmonize class boundaries. We used data from rivers in Spain to compare the IBMWP (Iberian Biological Monitoring Working Party) index, which is commonly used by water authorities in Spain and by several research centers, with the Intercalibration Common Multimetric Index (ICM-Star), which was used as a standard in the intercalibration exercise. We also used data from Spanish rivers to compare the multimetric indices ICM-7 (based on quantitative data) and ICM-9 (based on qualitative data) with the IBMWP. ICM-7 and ICM-9 were proposed by the Mediterranean Geographical Intercalibration Group (Med-GIG). Additionally, we evaluated two new multimetric indices, developed specifically for macroinvertebrate communities inhabiting Mediterranean river systems. One of these is based on quantitative data (ICM-10), while the other is based on qualitative data (ICM-11a). The results show that the IBMWP index responds well to the stressor gradient present in our data, and correlates well with ICM-Star. Moreover, the IBMWP quality class boundaries were consistent with the intercalibration requirements of the WFD. However, multimetric indices showed a more linear relation with the stressor gradient in our data, and less variation in reference values. In addition, they may provide more statistical power for detecting potential environmental impacts. Multimetric indices produced similar results for quantitative and qualitative data. Thus, ICM-10 (also named IMMi-T) and ICM-11a (also named IMMi-L) indices could be used to meet European Commission requirements for assessing the water quality in Spanish Mediterranean rivers.},

  abstract = {The degradation of aquatic ecosystems, induced by worldwide intensification in the use of both land and aquatic resources, has highlighted the critical need for innovative methods allowing an objective quantification and ranking of anthropogenic pressure effects on aquatic organisms. Such diagnostic tools have a great potential for defining robust management responses to anthropogenic pressures. Our objective was to explore how the outputs of three diagnostic tools (based on benthic diatoms, macroinvertebrates and fishes) could be combined to (i) disentangle the temporal effects of multiple pressures over two decades and (ii) provide policy-relevant information for stream managers and decision makers. The diagnostic tools estimated, using taxonomy- and trait-based metrics, the impairment probabilities of biotic assemblages over time by different pressure categories, describing the alteration of water quality, hydromorphology and land use related to anthropogenic activities, in French streams (number of sites = 312). The main result shows that a large proportion of the time series exhibited no significant temporal patterns over the two decades (61.5% to 87.8%, depending on the used tests). Among time series exhibiting significant change, positive trends in impairment probabilities (i.e., degradation) were less frequent than negative ones, indicating a modest improvement in water quality at national scale over the study period. However, trends can be substantially different according to hydroecoregion and pressure category. The three biological compartments displayed convergent temporal responses according to the pressure category and regional context (e.g., lowland plains vs. mountains, pristine vs. agricultural regions). Altogether, this study proposes a unifying approach to integrate a vast amount of information in a single ecological diagnosis using an unparalleled database on natural and anthropized environments. Strengthening the synthesis of biological information provided by various biological compartments should be a priority before implementing evidence-based sustainable conservation and restoration actions.},

This tool, including conditional tree forest (CTF) models, was built on combinations of benthic macroinvertebrate trait-based metrics for each of sixteen anthropogenic pressure categories.For eleven pressure categories, CTF models have given good impairment risk assessment (i.e. AUC. ≥. 0.70), even at moderate risk level and in a multi-pressure context. The four other models have provided poorer but promising results (AUC. =. 0.67. ±. 0.02).Identifying the potential weight of individual anthropogenic pressures that lead to biotic assemblage impairment in streams under multiple pressure scenario, is a key step for managers to implement appropriate stream restoration programs. Simultaneously considering the whole complexity of bio-ecological adaptations within biotic assemblages subjected to human pressures provides a functional diagnostic tool both (i) ecologically relevant and (ii) efficient for ERA. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {One of the key challenges to understanding patterns of $\beta$ diversity is to disentangle deterministic patterns from stochastic ones. Stochastic processes may mask the influence of deterministic factors on community dynamics, hindering identification of the mechanisms causing variation in community composition. We studied temporal $\beta$ diversity (among-year dissimilarity) of macroinvertebrate communities in near-pristine boreal streams across 14 years. To assess whether the observed $\beta$ diversity deviates from that expected by chance, and to identify processes (deterministic vs. stochastic) through which different explanatory factors affect community variability, we used a null model approach. We observed that at the majority of sites temporal $\beta$ diversity was low indicating high community stability. When stochastic variation was unaccounted for, connectivity was the only variable explaining temporal $\beta$ diversity, with weakly connected sites exhibiting higher community variability through time. After accounting for stochastic effects, connectivity lost importance, suggesting that it was related to temporal $\beta$ diversity via random colonization processes. Instead, $\beta$ diversity was best explained by in-stream vegetation, community variability decreasing with increasing bryophyte cover. These results highlight the potential of stochastic factors to dampen the influence of deterministic processes, affecting our ability to understand and predict changes in biological communities through time. Composition of biological communities at any given site or time is an outcome of deterministic and stochastic processes. Deterministic perspectives, such as the species-sorting concept 1 , view communities as a result of inter-actions between species and their biotic and abiotic environment, with each species having its own predictable niche. Due to environmental differences among habitats, each locality is advantageous for some species while disadvantageous for some others. At the other extreme, stochastic perspectives highlight random colonization and extinction and ecological drift, i.e. random population fluctuations, as mechanisms leading to communities where, in the strictest sense, all species have equal requirements and probability of colonizing a site 2, 3},

  abstract      = {Rising salinity in freshwater ecosystems can affect community composition. Previous studies mainly focused on changes in freshwater communities along gradients of absolute levels of electrical conductivity (EC). However, both geogenic and anthropogenic drivers contribute to the EC level and taxa may regionally be adapted to geogenic EC levels. Therefore, we examined the turnover in freshwater invertebrates along gradients of anthropogenic EC change in two regions of Germany. The anthropogenic change of EC was estimated as the difference between the measured EC and the modeled background EC driven by geochemical and climate variables. Turnover in freshwater invertebrates ($\beta$-diversity) was estimated using the Jaccard index (JI). We found that invertebrate turnover between EC gradient categories is generally greater than 47%, with a maximum of approximately 70% in sites with a more than 0.4 mS cm−1 change compared to the baseline (i.e. no difference between predicted and measured EC). The invertebrates Amphinemura sp., Anomalopterygella chauviniana and Leuctra sp. were reliable indicators of low EC change, whereas Potamopyrgus antipodarum indicated sites with the highest EC change. Variability within categories of EC change was slightly lower than within categories of absolute EC. Elevated nutrient concentrations that are often linked to land use may have contributed to the observed change of the invertebrate richness and can exacerbate effects of EC on communities in water. Overall, our study suggests that the change in EC, quantified as the difference between measured EC and modeled background EC, can be used to examine the response of invertebrate communities to increasing anthropogenic salinity concentrations in rivers. However, due to the strong correlation between EC change and observed EC in our study regions, the response to these two variables was very similar. Further studies in areas where EC change and observed EC are less correlated are required. In addition, such studies should consider the change in specific ions.},

  abstract      = {Human-induced reductions in species richness might alter the quality of ecosystem services when the remaining species are not able to substitute the functions provided by extirpated species. We examined how human disturbances (nutrient enrichment, land use intensification, instream habitat degradation and the presence of alien species) influence the species richness of stream invertebrates. Stream invertebrates (425 native species) were collected by kick and sweep sampling technique at 274 stream sites covering the entire area of Hungary. We measured the species richness, functional richness (i. e. number of unique functional roles provided by community members) and functional redundancy (i. e. the functional insurance of the community) using information on the feeding habits of each species. To remove the effect of natural variability, we tested the effect of stressors on the residuals of models relating species richness, functional richness and functional redundancy with natural environmental gradients. Our results showed that species richness was negatively influenced by instream habitat degradation and nutrient enrichment. Independent of the way of quantifying functional richness and functional redundancy, we found that functional richness is more sensitive to human impact than functional redundancy of stream invertebrates. The finding that a reduction of species richness is associated with a loss of unique functional roles (functional richness) is important for conservation issues, because the number of unique functional roles is usually regarded as driver of ecosystem functioning. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

  abstract        = {Stream communities are structured by factors acting over multiple spatial and temporal scales. Identifying what factors are driving spatial patterns in stream communities is a central aim of ecology. Here we used two large European data sets of fish, invertebrates, macrophytes, benthic diatoms and environmental data in two stream groups (lowland and mountain) to determine the importance of variables at different spatial scales (geographical, regional, local) on community structure. Both geographical position and ecoregion were selected first in canonical correspondence analysis (CCA), clearly showing the broad spatial gradients covered in the data set. Secondary predictors (after accounting for spatial and/or ecoregion effects) were similar between stream groups and among the four organism groups. In particular, conductivity and N concentration were strong predictors reflecting catchment land use. Using partial CCA, we assessed the individual importance of the three spatial scales on the community structure of the four organism groups in the two stream groups. The majority of among-site variability (22-29%) was accounted for by local scale variables (e.g. water chemistry and substratum type), with regional and spatial variables accounting 11-13% and 5-6%, respectively. Our findings indicate that the four organism groups are responding similarly to the different levels of spatial scale, implying much redundancy which should be consider when implementing studies of bioassessment. {\textcopyright} 2007 The Authors, Journal compilation 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

Ecoregions provide a holistic framework for flexible, comparative analysis of complex environmental problems. Ecoregions mapping has intellectual foundations in both geography and ecology. However, a hallmark of ecoregions mapping is that it is a truly interdisciplinary endeavor that demands the integration of knowledge from a multitude of sciences. Geographers emphasize the role of place, scale, and both natural and social elements when delineating and characterizing regions. Ecologists tend to focus on environmental processes with special attention given to energy flows and nutrient cycling. Integration of disparate knowledge from the many key sciences has been one of the great challenges of ecoregions mapping, and may lie at the heart of the lack of consensus on the "optimal" approach and methods to use in such work. Through a review of the principal existing US ecoregion maps, issues that should be addressed in order to advance the state of the art are identified. Research related to needs, methods, data sources, data delivery, and validation is needed. It is also important that the academic system foster education so that there is an infusion of new expertise in ecoregion mapping and use.},

To assess effects of these changes on associated biotic communities it is necessary to monitor and report on the status of lotic ecosystems. A variety of stream classification methods are available to assist with these tasks, and such methods attempt to provide a systematic approach to modeling and understanding complex aquatic systems at various spatial and temporal scales. Of the vast number of approaches that exist, it is useful to group them into three main types. The first involves modeling longitudinal species turnover patterns within large drainage basins and relating these patterns to environmental predictors collected at reach and upstream catchment scales; the second uses regionalized hierarchical classification to create multi-scale, spatially homogenous aquatic ecoregions by grouping adjacent catchments together based on environmental similarities; and the third approach groups sites together on the basis of similarities in their environmental conditions both within and between catchments, independent of their geographic location. We review the literature with a focus on more recent classifications to examine the strengths and weaknesses of the different approaches. We identify gaps or problems with the current approaches, and we propose an eight-step heuristic process that may assist with development of more flexible and integrated aquatic classifications based on the current understanding, network thinking, and theoretical underpinnings.},

  abstract      = {ecently, Jennions and M{\o}ller (2003) carried out a meta-analysis on statistical power in the field of behavioral ecology and animal behavior, reviewing 10 leading journals including Behavioral Ecology. Their results showed dismayingly low average statistical power (note that a meta-analytic review of statistical power is different from post hoc power analysis as criticized in Hoenig and Heisey, 2001). The statistical power of a null hypothesis (Ho) significance test is the probability that the test will reject Ho when a research hypothesis (Ha) is true. Knowledge of effect size is particularly important for statistical power analysis (for statistical power analysis, see Cohen, 1988; Nakagawa and Foster, in press). There are many kinds of effect size measures available (e.g., Pearson's r, Cohen's d, Hedges's g), but most of these fall into one of two major types, namely the r family and the d family (Rosenthal, 1994). The r family shows the strength of relationship between two variables while the d family shows the size of difference between two variables. As a benchmark for research planning and evaluation, Cohen (1988) proposed ‘conventional' values for small, medium, and large effects: r =.10,.30, and.50 and d =.20,.50, and.80, respectively (in the way that p values of.05,.01, and.001 are conventional points, although these conventional values of effect size have been criticized; e.g., Rosenthal et al., 2000). The meta-analysis on statistical power by Jennions and M{\o}ller (2003) revealed that, in the field of behavioral ecology and animal behavior, statistical power of less than 20% to detect a small effect and power of less than 50% to detect a medium effect existed. This means, for example, that the average behavioral scientist performing a statistical test has a greater probability of making a Type II error (or {\ss}) (i.e., not rejecting Ho when Ho is false; note that statistical power is equals to 1 – {\ss}) than if they had flipped a coin, when an experiment effect is of medium size (i.e., r =.30, d =.50). Here, I highlight and discuss an implication of this low statistical power on one of the most widely used statistical procedures, Bonferroni correction (Cabin and Mitchell, 2000). Bonferroni corrections are employed to reduce Type I errors (i.e., rejecting Ho when Ho is true) when multiple tests or comparisons are conducted. Two kinds of Bonferroni procedures are commonly used. One is the standard Bonferroni procedure, where a modified significant criterion (/k where k is the number of statistical tests conducted on given data) is used. The other is the sequential Bonferroni procedure, which was introduced by Holm (1979) and popularized in the field of ecology and evolution by Rice (1989) (see these papers for the procedure). For example, in a recent volume of Behavioral Ecology (vol. 13, 2002), nearly one-fifth of papers (23 out of 117) included Bonferroni corrections. Twelve articles employed the standard procedure while 11 articles employed the sequential procedure (10 citing Rice, 1989, and one citing Holm, 1979). A serious problem associated with the standard Bonferroni procedure is a substantial reduction in the statistical power of rejecting an incorrect Ho in each test (e.g., Holm, 1979; Perneger, 1998; Rice, 1989). The sequential Bonferroni procedure also incurs reduction in power, but to a lesser extent (which is the reason that the sequential procedure is used in preference by some researchers; Moran, 2003). Thus, both procedures exacerbate the existing problem of low power, identified by Jennions and M{\o}ller (2003). For example, suppose an experiment where both an experimental group and a control group consist of 30 subjects. After an experimental period, we measure five different variables and conduct a series of t tests on each variable. Even prior to applying Bonferroni corrections, the statistical power of each test to detect a medium effect is 61% (=.05), which is less than a recommended acceptable 80% level (Cohen, 1988). In the field of behavioral ecology and animal behavior, it is usually difficult to use large sample sizes (in many cases, n < 30) because of practical and ethical reasons (see Still, 1992). When standard Bonferroni corrections are applied, the statistical power of each t test drops to as low as 33% (to detect a medium effect at /5 =.01). Although sequential Bonferroni corrections do not reduce the power of the tests to the same extent, on average (33–61% per t test), the probability of making a Type II error for some of the tests ({\ss} = 1 – power, so 39–66%) remains unacceptably high. Furthermore, statistical power would be even lower if we measured more than five variables or if we were interested in detecting a small effect. Bonferroni procedures appear to raise another set of problems. There is no formal consensus for when Bonferroni procedures should be used, even among statisticians (Perneger, 1998). It seems, in some cases, that Bonferroni corrections are applied only when their results remain significant. Some researchers may think that their results are ‘more significant' if the results pass the rigor of Bonferroni corrections, although this is logically incorrect (Cohen, 1990, 1994; Yoccoz, 1991). Many researchers are already reluctant to report nonsignificant results (Jennions and M{\o}ller, 2002a,b). The wide use of Bonferroni procedures may be aggravating the tendency of researchers not to present nonsignificant results, because presentation of more tests with nonsignificant results may make previously ‘significant' results ‘nonsignificant' under Bonferroni procedures. The more detailed research (i.e., research measuring more variables) researchers do, the less probability they have of finding significant results. Moran (2003) recently named this paradox as a hyper-Red Queen phenomenon (see the paper for more discussion on problems with the sequential method). Imagine that we conduct a study where we measure as many relevant variables as possible, 10 variables, for example. We find only two variables statistically significant. Then, what should we do? We could decide to write a paper highlighting these two variables (and not reporting the other eight at all) as if we had hypotheses about the two significant variables in the first place. Subsequently, our paper would be published. Alternatively, we could write a paper including all 10 variables. When the paper is reviewed, referees might tell us that there were no significant results if we had ‘appropriately' employed Bonferroni corrections, so that our study would not be advisable for publication. However, the latter paper is scientifically more important than the former paper. For example, if one wants to conduct a meta-analysis to investigate an overall effect in a specific area of study, the latter paper is five times more informative than the former paper. In the long term, statistical significance of particular tests may be of trivial importance (if not always), although, in the short term, it makes papers publishable. Bonferroni procedures may, in part, be preventing the accumulation of knowledge in the field of behavioral ecology and animal behavior, thus hindering the progress of the field as science. However, it is true that researchers often seem to measure apparently irrelevant variables in their study, unnecessarily expanding a probability of making Type I errors. Therefore, it is understandable that reviewers sometimes have to demand Bonferroni corrections for such studies. As explained above, the use of Bonferroni procedures further reduce power, increasing a Type II error to unacceptable levels, and they may also contribute to publication bias, hindering the advance of the field. Therefore, the use of Bonferroni corrections and the practice of reviewers demanding Bonferroni procedures should be discouraged (and also, researchers should play their part in carefully selecting relevant variables in their study). These problems probably stem from overemphasis on statistical significance (i.e., p values) in journals rather than more emphasis on practical or biological significance (i.e., effect size) (Cohen, 1990). I recommend routine presentation of observed (standardized) effect size, such as Pearson's r and Cohen's d, in journal articles (r and d are readily convertible; Rosenthal, 1994), as also recommended by Stoehr (1999) and Jennions and M{\o}ller (2003)(see these papers for various benefits of reporting effect size; see also Kirk, 1996). Standardized effect sizes are degrees of experimental effects, which are comparable across studies even with different sample sizes (note that p values do not tell us what degree of experimental effect is present; Cohen, 1990, 1994; Yoccoz, 1991). Thus, reporting observed effect size, along with exact p values, allows readers as well as researchers to evaluate the biological importance (and statistical significance) of results. Although presenting standardized effect size is still not common in ecology and evolution, some journals in other disciplines oblige or strongly recommend researchers to present effect size (e.g., Murphy, 1997; Wilkinson and The Task Force on Statistical Inference, 1999). Furthermore, reporting not only effect sizes but also confidence intervals (CIs) for effect sizes may prove more useful (see Thompson, 2002, and references therein for software that calculates CIs for effect sizes), because the CIs for effect sizes can be used to interpret nonsignificant results (see Hoenig and Heisey, 2001; Colegrave and Ruxton, 2003; Jennions and M{\o}ller, 2003; Nakagawa and Foster, in press). Additionally, if research involves a large number of variables, controlling ‘false discovery rate' (FDR; the proportion of rejecting true Hos; cf., Bernoulli equation in Moran, 2003) may be an option rather than controlling the probability of obtaining even one false rejection of Ho (i.e., using Bonferroni corrections), as Garc{\'{i}}a (2003)recently highlighted.

Common pitfalls during application, the statistical properties of many ecological datasets, and the strong control of the tablewise error rate made by the widely used sequential Bonferroni procedures, seem to be responsible for some ‘illogical' results when such corrections are applied. Sharpened Bonferroni-type procedures may alleviate the decrease in power associated to standard methods as the number of tests increases. More powerful methods, based on controlling the false discovery rate (FDR), deserve a more frequent use in ecological studies, especially in those involving large repeated-test tables in which several or many individual null hypotheses have been rejected, and the most significant p-value is relatively large. I conclude that some reasonable control of alpha inflation is required of authors as a safeguard against striking, but spurious findings, which may strongly affect the credibility of ecological research.},

  abstract        = {Hydrological variables are among the most influential when analyzing or modeling stream ecosystems. However, available hydrological data are often limited in their spatiotemporal scale and resolution for use in ecological applications such as predictive modeling of species distributions. To overcome this limitation, a regression model was applied to a 1 km gridded stream network of Germany to obtain estimated daily stream flow data (m3 s−1) spanning 64 years (1950–2013). The data are used as input to calculate hydrological indices characterizing stream flow regimes. Both temporal and spatial validations were performed. In addition, GLMs using both the calculated and observed hydrological indices were compared, suggesting that the predicted flow data are adequate for use in predictive ecological models. Accordingly, we provide estimated stream flow as well as a set of 53 hydrological metrics at 1 km grid for the stream network of Germany. In addition, we provide an R script where the presented methodology is implemented, that uses globally available data and can be directly applied to any other geographical region.},

Location: Seventy- eight wetland ponds in Patagonia (Argentina) covering a study area of 3.5 × 105 km2. Time period: Ponds were sampled once between 2006 and 2014. Major taxa studied: One hundred and fifty- eight taxa of wetland aquatic invertebrates. Methods: We generated two beta diversity matrices (based on flying and non- flying invertebrates) and six predictor matrices, including three environmental distance ma- trices, a topographic distance between ponds, and two wind pairwise matrices differ- ing in wind speed. Using Moran spectral randomization of Mantel (MSR- Mantel) tests (which account for spatial autocorrelation), we assessed the relationship between the response and the predictor matrices. We used a network- constrained version of the nestedness metric based on overlap and decreasing fill (NODF), to assess if wind anisotropy (i.e., direction- dependent) affected community nestedness among ponds. Results: Flying dispersers' dissimilarity was significantly explained by environmen- tal variables, whereas non- flying invertebrates' dissimilarity was not significantly explained by any of the distances tested. When wind direction was ignored, wind speed had a negligible effect on both types of communities, whereas when it was considered a consistent nested pattern emerged, with the eastern ponds (downwind) communities being subsets of those from the western ponds (upwind).},

The data set was comprised of 1 766 104 measurements of 478 pesticides (including metabolites) related to 24 743 samples from 2301 sampling sites. We investigated the influence of agricultural land use, catchment size, as well as precipitation and seasonal dynamics on pesticide risk taking also concentrations below the limit of quantification into account. The exceedances of risk thresholds dropped 3.7-fold at sites with no agriculture. Precipitation increased detection probability by 43%, and concentrations were the highest from April to June. Overall, this indicates that agricultural land use is a major contributor of pesticides in streams. RACs were exceeded in 26% of streams, with the highest exceedances found for neonicotinoid insecticides. We conclude that pesticides from agricultural land use are a major threat to small streams and their biodiversity. To reflect peak concentrations, current pesticide monitoring needs refinement.},

Each data set was subjected to a series of different techniques for the introduction of error. The results indicate that the beta-flexible method with $\beta$ = −.25 or −.2 generally produces recovery rates that are competitive with the group average and Ward's (1963) technique. When outliers are present in the data, values in the range −.7 ≤ $\beta$ ≤ −.4 are needed. The beta-flexible method showed a more stable or robust performance pattern than the two competing procedures across the differing error conditions.

  abstract      = {One of the most pervasive concepts in the study of community assembly is the metaphor of the environmental filter, which refers to abiotic factors that prevent the establishment or persistence of species in a particular location. The metaphor has its origins in the study of community change during succession and in plant community dynamics, although it has gained considerable attention recently as part of a surge of interest in functional trait and phylogenetic-based approaches to the study of communities. While the filtering metaphor has clear utility in some circumstances, it has been challenging to reconcile the environmental filtering concept with recent developments in ecological theory related to species coexistence. These advances suggest that the evidence used in many studies to assess environmental filtering is insufficient to distinguish filtering from the outcome of biotic interactions. We re-examine the environmental filtering metaphor from the perspective of coexistence theory. In an effort to move the discussion forward, we present a simple framework for considering the role of the environment in shaping community membership, review the literature to document the evidence typically used in environmental filtering studies and highlight research challenges to address in coming years. The current usage of the environmental filtering term in empirical studies likely overstates the role abiotic tolerances play in shaping community structure. We recommend that the term ‘environmental filtering' only be used to refer to cases where the abiotic environment prevents establishment or persistence in the absence of biotic interactions, although only 15% of the studies in our review presented such evidence. Finally, we urge community ecologists to consider additional mechanisms aside from environmental filtering by which the abiotic environment can shape community pattern.},

  abstract        = {Functional homogenisation of ecological communities (i.e. communities composed mainly of generalist species) is a major concern and has been often considered as a non-random effect of anthropogenic stress, with generalist taxa being preferentially selected under increasing stress. However, the degree of specialisation of a given taxon for a particular resource (a convenient proxy for studying functional homogenisation) is often described simply as 'uses the resource' or 'does not', despite there being an obvious continuum of degrees of specialisation by species for many different resources. Moreover, the non-randomness of the relationship between resource specialisation by the species making up a community and anthropogenic stress has been rarely tested. In this study, a framework based on fuzzy-coded traits is proposed to calculate a new continuous index of potential specialisation for a variety of taxa in a wide range of ecosystems. The use of this index is illustrated using 10 Eltonian and 11 Grinnellian traits of stream macroinvertebrate assemblages. We tested (i) the significance of the relationships between the average degree of specialisation among the taxa of a community and two types of anthropogenic stress (acidification and organic contamination) at the local scale and (ii) the non-randomness of these relationships. Stress gradients explained, through non-random effects, a rather high proportion of the variability observed in the degree of taxon specialisation, with significant relationships for eight of the 21 traits studied with regard to acidification and for 18 of the 21 traits with regard to organic contamination. Although most of these relationships described functional homogenisation (i.e. decreasing specialisation with increasing stress), increasing specialisation with increasing stress was demonstrated for a few Eltonian traits. We confirmed the importance of indicators of functional homogenisation calculated at the community level when studying the loss of biodiversity due to anthropogenic stress. The assessment of ecological specialisation seems to be a very promising strategy for understanding the effects of habitat impairment on community and ecosystem processes. Moreover, we show that the intensity of functional homogenisation depends on a trade-off between 'direct' and 'indirect' effects of stressors, and we consider that more attention should be paid to the mechanisms by which anthropogenic stressors act on taxa. {\textcopyright} 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

  abstract = {One objective of the European Union (EU)'s Water Framework Directive (WFD: Directive 2000/60/EC) is for all European surface waters to achieve ‘good status’ by 2015. In support of this objective, the EU has facilitated an intercalibration exercise to ensure harmonized definitions of the status of water bodies, reflecting the deviation of their properties (mainly biotic assemblages) from a minimally disturbed state, termed the “reference condition”. One of the major challenges of the WFD has been to find common approaches for defining reference conditions and to define the level of anthropogenic intervention allowed in reference sites. In this paper we describe how river reference sites were selected in the Central-Baltic region of Europe. A list of pressure criteria was provided and 14 Member States (MSs) categorized each criterion according to the method (i.e. measured, field inspection, etc.) used for reference site screening. Additionally, reference land-use and water-chemistry thresholds were agreed among countries in order to base reference site selection on objective criteria. For land-use criteria, a reference threshold and a rejection threshold were established. Sites with all criteria below the reference threshold were considered to be reference sites; sites having most criteria below the reference threshold and only some parameters between the reference and rejection threshold were “possible reference sites”. These sites were retained only after carefully checking the cumulative effects of the pressures using local expertise, and a posteriori water-chemistry evaluation was necessary. In general, the most widespread method for defining a reference site was the measurement of pressures, followed by field inspections and expert judgment. However, some major pressures (e.g. hydromorphological alteration) were evaluated in a number of different ways (e.g. measured, field inspection, expert judgment). Our meta-analyses reveal a need to reinforce standardization in the application of pressure criteria by Member States. The pressure criteria identified in this exercise should be refined and tested with biological data to help in the further validation of minimally disturbed sites (i.e. the WFD “reference condition”) and to provide a firm foundation for ecological status assessment. This in turn would ensure that there is pan-European comparability when evaluating the achievement of environmental objectives.},

  abstract        = {One of the biggest challenges when conducting a continental-scale assessment of streams is setting appropriate expectations for the assessed sites. The challenge occurs for 2 reasons: 1) tremendous natural environmental heterogeneity exists within a continental landscape and 2) reference sites vary in quality both across and within major regions of the continent. We describe the process used to set expectations for the multimetric index of biotic integrity (MIBI) and observed/expected (O/E) indices generated from predictive models used to assess stream condition for the US Wadeable Streams Assessment (WSA). The assessment was based on a reference-site approach, in which the least-disturbed sites in each region of the US were used to establish benchmarks for assessing the condition of macroinvertebrate assemblages at other sites. Reference sites were compiled by filtering WSA sample sites for disturbance using a series of abiotic variables. Additional reference sites were needed and were obtained from other state, university, and federal monitoring programs. This pool of potential reference sites was then assessed for uniformity in site quality and comparability of macroinvertebrate sample data. Ultimately, 1625 sites were used to set reference expectations for the WSA. Reference-site data were used to help define 9 large ecoregions that minimized the naturally occurring variation in macroinvertebrate assemblages associated with continental-wide differences in biogeography. These ecoregions were used as a basis for developing MIBI and O/E indices and for reporting results. A least-disturbed definition of reference condition was used nationally, but we suspect that the quality of the best extant sites in ecoregions, such as the Northern Plains and Temperate Plains, was lower than that of sites in other ecoregions. For the MIBI assessment, we used a simple modeling approach to adjust scores in ecoregions where gradients in reference-site quality could be demonstrated conclusively. The WSA provided an unparalleled opportunity to push the limits of our conceptual and technical understanding of how to best apply a reference-condition approach to a real-world need. Our hope is that we have learned enough from this exercise to improve the technical quality of the next round of national assessments. {\textcopyright} 2008 by The North American Benthological Society.},

  abstract      = {Measuring the status and trends of biodiversity is critical for making informed decisions about the conservation, management or restoration of species, habitats and ecosystems. Defining the reference state against which status and change are measured is essential. Typically, reference states describe historical conditions, yet historical conditions are challenging to quantify, may be difficult to falsify, and may no longer be an attainable target in a contemporary ecosystem. We have constructed a conceptual framework to help inform thinking and discussion around the philosophical underpinnings of reference states and guide their application. We characterize currently recognized historical reference states and describe them as Pre-Human, Indigenous Cultural, Pre-Intensification and Hybrid-Historical. We extend the conceptual framework to include contemporary reference states as an alternative theoretical perspective. The contemporary reference state framework is a major conceptual shift that focuses on current ecological patterns and identifies areas with higher biodiversity values relative to other locations within the same ecosystem, regardless of the disturbance history. We acknowledge that past processes play an essential role in driving contemporary patterns of diversity. The specific context for which we design the contemporary conceptual frame is underpinned by an overarching goal—to maximize biodiversity conservation and restoration outcomes in existing ecosystems. The contemporary reference state framework can account for the inherent differences in the diversity of biodiversity values (e.g. native species richness, habitat complexity) across spatial scales, communities and ecosystems. In contrast to historical reference states, contemporary references states are measurable and falsifiable. This ‘road map of reference states' offers perspective needed to define and assess the status and trends in biodiversity and habitats. We demonstrate the contemporary reference state concept with an example from south-eastern Australia. Our framework provides a tractable way for policy-makers and practitioners to navigate biodiversity assessments to maximize conservation and restoration outcomes in contemporary ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Riffle beetles in the family Elmidae are frequent members of the invertebrate community of running water. Over 80 species have been recorded in North America and 46 in Europe; this number decreases in the western and northern fringes of Europe with only 12 species in Britain, many rare, four in Ireland and three in Norway. The present review describes their habitat, food and predators, their life cycles, their dispersal, and human threats to their survival. All elmid species have aquatic larvae with five to eight instars, depending on the genus. Adults of a few species are terrestrial, but most are aquatic with plastron respiration. Most elmid species occur in well-aerated streams and rivers, but some also occur on wave-washed lake shores. A few species live in more unusual habitats, such as thermal pools and hot springs, subterranean habitats, and decaying wood. Little is known about the food of adults or larvae, but they appear to be collector-gatherers and scrapers that feed chiefly on algae and detritus. Adults and larvae are rarely taken by invertebrate predators, but are eaten by fish, especially salmonids. However, their proportion in the diet is always lower than that in the benthos, indicating low availability to the fish. To obtain a quantitative description of the life cycle, information is required on the number of larvae in each instar, the timing of oviposition, the number of eggs laid, the timing of pupation, and the number of adults. Few studies meet these criteria. However, three excellent studies from North America and a detailed study of the four commonest British species illustrate the variation in the life cycles of different species. Life tables, identifying critical periods for survival, are provided for the British species, these being the only such tables currently available for riffle beetles. The ability to disperse by flight varies among species and among individuals of the same species. Adults and larvae disperse downstream in the invertebrate drift, especially at night. In one study, drift densities of different life stages were related positively to their monthly losses in the benthos, but not to their benthic densities. Less information is available on their upstream–downstream movements on the substratum. There are ontogenetic shifts in diel drift periodicity and dispersal, and both relate to seasonal changes in drift density and critical periods for survival in the life cycle. Human threats to the survival of elmids include reduced oxygen concentrations, elevation of water temperature, extremes of flow, especially spates, and pollution, especially by soaps and detergents. Therefore, riffle beetles provide excellent indicators of water quality and perhaps also climate change},

Th e ecological status has to be defi ned based on near-natural reference conditions. Benthic invertebrates and diatoms are among the key biological elements recommended by the Directive to assess ecological quality of water bodies. Th e purpose of this study is to identify species associations of these biological elements that are characteristic of the diff erent stream types occurring in Luxembourg and that distinguish degraded from reference conditions. In general, the results reveal that diatoms and invertebrates can be considered as complementary indicators with more diatom species being characteristic of small size stream types and more benthic invertebrate species being associated with larger stream types. Among invertebrates, Trichoptera, Hydrachnidia, Ephemeroptera and Diptera show high affi nities for most stream types. Plecoptera, Oligochaeta appear as useful indicators for some particular types. If only reference sites are selected (all river types considered), the number of indicator species drops from 55 to 24 for diatoms and from 81 to 48 for benthic invertebrates. Moreover, for the larger stream type, no reference site was found at all. Th is trend is likely to be a consequence of the multiple anthropogenic pressures that have aff ected large parts of European lowland rivers for decades. Our results suggest that Trichoptera, Hydrachnidia, Diptera, Ephemeroptera and Oligochaeta could be considered as best candidate groups for a tiered-taxonomic resolution approach where only taxa which have narrow and specifi c ecological requirements would be identifi ed to fi ner levels.

  abstract      = {The Biological Diatom Index (BDI) is a standardized method routinely used in France for the surveillance of watercourse quality. This index is based on a list of 209 key species showing different pollution sensitivities. The pollution sensitivity, or "ecological profile", is determined through the species presence probability values along a seven quality classes gradient. In a sample, the presence and abundance of species from this list are used to calculate the BDI score. Recently, water managers pointed out several weaknesses of this index: (a) the BDI fails to correctly assess water quality in acidobiontic and brackish conditions, and (b) pollution sensitivity and tolerance of several key species used to calculate the index need to be improved. This paper presents and discusses the new version of the BDI, called BDI-2006. 2802 samples were used to create this new index (samples collected on all French river types during the last thirty years), where 1063 diatom species were identified. For each sample, the community was described with species relative abundance, and relevant physico-chemical parameters were collected: pH, conductivity, dissolved oxygen, biological oxygen demand, ammonium, orthophosphates and nitrates. Eight hundreds and thirty eight key species were finally kept, including species typical of acidic and brackish waters, tropical taxa and abnormal forms of many widespread taxa (as evidence of toxicological impacts). The physico-chemical and the biological datasets were explored with classical analysis (Principal Component Analysis) and neural networks (Self-Organizing Maps), combined to draw the new key species ecological profiles. Comparing to the initial version of the BDI, several species profiles (Nitzschia paleacea for example) were clearly enhanced. This new version was adopted by the French standardisation authority (AFNOR) in October 2007. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract      = {We have analysed the geographical records of a representative selection of extant diatom species from a freshwater pond. The more often a species is recorded in the ecological literature, the greater is its apparent global distribution. One explanation is that the frequently recorded species are globally abundant, whereas species that are infrequently recorded are globally rare. We suggest a model in which random dispersal is the dominant force driving large-scale distribution of species, with the rate and scale of dispersal largely determined by global population size. Thus species that are locally rare or abundant are likewise rare or abundant worldwide. It is predicted that many of the rarer diatom species will, with additional sampling effort, be shown to have wide geographical distribution, but this requires intensive studies focused on revealing species that are normally cryptic. The argument in favour of endemic diatom species is untenable, because it is not possible to disprove their existence elsewhere in the biosphere.},

  abstract      = {Water scarcity is becoming one of the greatest challenges that human societies will face during this century. Monitoring water availability is expensive and technically challenging. In this regard, biological communities (e.g. aquatic insects) offer a cost-effective alternative, since they integrate temporal and spatial hydrological variability. Here we explore the potential of Chironomidae (Diptera), which have been usually neglected due to their complex taxonomy, as indicators of both local habitat condition and water scarcity. The study took place in 28 sites across seven dryland streams distributed within a 400 km2 section of the Upper San Pedro River basin, southeastern Arizona. The selected streams covered a wide range of hydrological variability, which was continuously measured through the deployment of 15 electrical resistance (ER) sensors. Chironomidae taxa with no drought-resistance strategies were rarely found in streams that experienced frequent drying events (i.e. intermittent and ephemeral streams), suggesting that droughts have the potential to reduce species richness due to local extinctions of drought-intolerant taxa. Intermittent and ephemeral streams registered low canopy cover and a significantly higher abundance of scrapers (which mainly feed on algae) and shredders (feeding on poorly decomposed coarse organic material). This suggests that structural changes associated to drought (e.g. reduced canopy cover and decomposition rates) might lead to changes in the functional composition of the Chironomidae assemblages. We conclude that Chironomidae species can be used as indicators of hydrological variability and the impacts of drought on streams in the absence of flow gauges.},

We assessed cross-taxonomic level congruence, as well as taxonomic structure-environment and taxon richness-environment relationships in stream macroinvertebrate and diatom data surveyed across Finland. A number of interesting and important findings emerged from our analyses. For both macroinvertebrates and diatoms, species richness was strongly correlated with genus and family richness, and similarities in assemblage structure between species-, genus- and family-level matrices were also significant and relatively strong. For macroinvertebrates, the key environmental variables for assemblage structure and taxon richness remained the same irrespective of taxonomic level. For diatoms, however, the environmental variables related to variation in diatom taxon richness varied between taxonomic data sets, while determinants of assemblage structure remained largely the same. For macroinvertebrates, relatively similar amounts of variation in assemblage structure and taxon richness for species-, genus-, and family-level data were accounted for by the environmental variables, shared environmental and spatial variables, spatial variables, and total variation explained. By contrast, for diatoms, these components of variability differed somewhat between taxonomic levels. Our results suggest that, for macroinvertebrates, even family-level data could be used in rapid biodiversity assessments, where the objective is to examine biodiversity patterns and rank sites according to their conservation value in our study region. Families might also perform well in this task in other regions that are characterized by low faunal species diversity, but the situation is likely to be different for regions with higher species diversity. Although weaker than the relationships in macroinvertebrate data, species-level data for diatoms also showed rather similar patterns to genus- and family-level data. However, due to the low number of diatom families, it is likely that families do not provide enough variability in biodiversity patterns. Thus, for diatoms, genus-level data could perhaps be more efficient than family-level data in correlating with species-level data and portraying assemblage patterns for conservation purposes. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Tests of resemblance matrix concordance within taxonomic levels showed that not all matrices were strongly correlated. Presence/absence matrices showed poor correlations with raw abundance matrices, possibly reflecting the fact that a few dominant species were responsible for assemblage patterns in the latter. By contrast, logarithmic and square-root data generally showed strong matrix correlations, and this pattern existed at the species, genus, and family levels. Assemblage-environment relationships were rather similar between species-, genus-, and family-level data sets, given that the same key environmental variables were included in the final environmental dissimilarity matrices in BIO-ENV analysis. In conclusion, researchers should pay considerable attention to data transformations when interpreting assemblage patterns at different taxonomic levels and comparing different studies, as different data transformations may provide differing information and lead to highly differing conclusions.},

With both ordination techniques, the ordinations of each data set (including the original) revealed the same three underlying gradients. An altitudinal gradient consistently achieved the highest correlations with the ordinations (r = 0.71-0.93), followed by a substratum gradient (r = 0.50-0.88) and a combined pH and conductivity gradient (r = 0.47-0.76).

  abstract      = {SUMMARY. 1. Macro‐invertebrate samples were collected from 268 running‐water sites in Great Britain in each of three seasons (spring, summer and autumn). A combined seasons'treatment was generated by amalgamating the individual seasons'data. These four seasonal options were each subjected to four distinct taxonomic analyses differing in level of identification and whether the data were quantitative or qualitative. Thus sixteen data‐sets were available for analysis. Environmental data on physical and chemical variables, macrophyte cover and date of sampling were also recorded for each site. 2. All sixteen data‐sets were ordinated by detrended correspondence analysis and classified by two‐way indicator species analysis. There were strong correlations between the sixteen ordinations and significant concordance between classifications. 3. The relationships between ordination scores and single environmental variables were investigated. Muhiple discriminant analysis was used to fit environmental data to eight selected classifications covering the full range of seasonal and taxonomic treatments. The environmental variables most useful in distinguishing between rivers were substratum characteristics, alkalinity and total oxidized nitrogen. Within‐river differences were often highly correlated with discharge, distance from source, width and depth. Slope and altitude contributed strongly to both between‐river and within‐river distinctions. 4. Between‐site variation (beta diversity), eigenvalues of ordination, the reliability of classifications, the proportion of sites correctly assigned to their biological group using environmental data and the standardized similarity between observed and predicted fauna were all higher when identifications were taken to species level, rather than one of three family treatments. Qualitative data on a reduced list of families gave comparable or better results than more detailed family treatments. 5. Combined seasons'data enabled better categorization and prediction than single season's. 6. The values of the Czekanowski Index of Similarity between the observed and predicted fauna of test sites were close to realistic maximum values. 7. Recommendations are made concerning potential usages of the various classifications. The species level classification has uses in the field of conservation and in the prediction of biological response to environmental change. The family level classifications have value in developing local site inventories and in the interpretation of pollution surveillance programmes. Copyright {\textcopyright} 1984, Wiley Blackwell.

  abstract      = {SUMMARY. Data on the macroinvertebrate riffle fauna and physicochemistry of 368 upland streams were collated for areas in Wales. Scotland and N.W. England. TWINSPAN classification of the national macroinvertebrate data at the‘family' level produced either two or four groups of streams which differed markedly in invertebrate fauna and acidity. The analysis also produced an indicator key based on the presence/absence of macroinvertebrate taxa which could be used to allocate new sites to the stream groups. Multiple Discriminant Analysis (MDA) indicated that sets of environmental variables, which principally included pH or aluminium and calcium concentrations, discriminated effectively between the stream groups defined by TWINSPAN. These variables were incorporated into models which predicted faunal TWINSPAN groups from physicochemical data alone. TWINSPAN classification and the MDA models were tested by application to new sites either reserved from the initial data set (RESERVED) or sampled during fieldwork in spring 1989 (FIELD). For the RESERVED data there was 75–80% agreement between the two systems when two TWINSPAN groups were defined and 53–55% with four groups. Agreement was lower for the FIELD data, probably because chemical description was based on only one spot‐sample. Distributions of pH and aluminium concentration for the groups of test sites classified by macroinvertebrate indicator key corresponded reasonably well to distributions of these determinands at sites in the four original TWINSPAN groups. Correspondence was better for the RESERVED than for the FIELD data set. Copyright {\textcopyright} 1990, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved},

Quantitative data sets describing communities of benthic invertebrates identified to genus were aggregated to family, order, class, and phylum. Bray-Curtis distances between each pair of communities in a given study were calculated at each level of taxonomic aggregation. Also, quantitative data were converted to qualitative (presence-absence) data and aggregated in the same manner. Jaccard's distances between communities were calculated for these data matrices. Correlations between the resulting distance matrices, calculated at different taxonomic resolutions, were quantified using Mantel's test (N. Mantel. 1967. Cancer Res. 27: 209-220). Distance matrices for different taxonomic resolutions were highly correlated (r >> 0.64) when based on quantitative data for all except 1 of the 10 studies. Correlations were lower and more variable for qualitative data sets. For the data sets investigated, genus-level identification did not usually provide a strikingly different description of community patterns than higher levels (e.g., family, order) of taxonomic identification.},

  abstract      = {1. During late spring 1993-1995, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program (EMAP) sampled 490 wadeable streams in the mid-Atlantic Highlands (MAH) of the U.S. for a variety of physical, chemical and biological indicators of environmental condition. We used the resulting data set to evaluate the importance of differing levels of macroinvertebrate taxonomic resolution in bioassessments by comparing the ability of family versus genus to detect differences among sites classified by type and magnitude of human impact and by stream size. We divided the MAH into two physiographic regions: the Appalachian Plateau where mine drainage (MD) and acidic deposition are major stressors, and the Ridge and Valley where nutrient enrichment is a major stressor. Stream sites were classified into three or four impact classes based on water chemistry and habitat. We used stream order (first to third Strahler order) in each region as a measure of stream size. Ordination, 2 x 2 chi-square and biotic metrics were used to compare the ability of family and genus to detect differences among both stressor and size classes. 2. With one notable exception, there were only a small number of different genera per family (interquartile range = 1-4). Family Chironomidae, however, contained 123 different genera. As a result, significant information loss occurred when this group was only classified to family. The family Chironomidae did not discriminate among the predefined classes but many chironomid genera did: by chi-square analysis, 10 and 28 chironomid genera were significant in discriminating MD and nutrient impacts, respectively. 3. Family and genus data were similar in their ability to distinguish among the coarse impacts (e.g. most severe versus least severe impact classes) for all cases. Though genus data in many cases distinguished the subtler differences (e.g. mixed/moderate impacts versus high or low impacts) better than family, differences in significance levels between family and genus analyses were relatively minor. However, genus data detected differences among stream orders in ordination analyses that were not revealed at the family level. In the ordinations, both family and genus levels of analysis responded to similar suites of environmental variables. 4. Our results suggest that identification to the family level is sufficient for many bioassessment purposes. However, identifications to genus do provide more information in genera-rich families like Chironomidae. Genus or finer levels of identification are important for investigating natural history, stream ecology, biodiversity and indicator species. Decisions about the taxonomic level of identification need to be study specific and depend on available resources (cost) and study objectives.},

Fifty-five reference sites were originally selected for building the model, but this number was reduced to 51 (lowest level), 52 (family), and 53 (order), after the grouping procedures (CLUSTER, MDS, and SIMPER; Primer 5.2.6, Primer-E Ltd., Plymouth, UK). The discriminating variables (stepwise discriminant analysis) stream order, current velocity, pool quality, and substrate quality were common to the genus (species) and family models. Substrate quality was the only discriminating variable of the order model. The model performances, based on their ability to correctly predict reference site membership (complete MDS with jackknifed cross-validation), ranged from 78% (lowest level) to 81% (family and order levels). Twenty test sites were used to compare site assessments using each of the models. We concluded that the lowest-level model of identification provides the best evaluations of water quality assessment and performed well, that the family-level model reacted similarly and could be a good alternative for bioassessment programmes, and that a greater effort toward improving our knowledge of aquatic macroinvertebrates in Portugal is recommended as species are important in assessing water quality. {\textcopyright} 2006 NRC.},

  abstract      = {It is typically at the species level where the responses of organisms to natural environmental gradients are the most clearly visible. However, due to the fact that many organismal groups are poorly resolved at the species level in various geographical regions, many studies have to still rely on supra-specific taxa when analyzing community-environment relationships. This study examined the community-environment and richness-environment relationships of stream macroinvertebrates at three taxonomic levels (i.e., species, genus, family) in three high-latitude drainage basins. Despite the fact that species-to-genus and species-to-family ratios were low and of similar magnitude in all drainage basins, each region showed different rankings in terms of the species-, genus- and family-level data being best explained by environmental variables. Furthermore, within each region the three taxonomic levels did not respond similarly to the underlying environmental gradients, which was evident with taxonomic richness and taxonomic composition based on both quantitative and qualitative data (adjusted R2 of models varied from 0 to 0.604 for taxonomic richness and from 0.068 to 0.307 for taxonomic composition). The present findings thus do not support the views: (i) taxonomic surrogacy in stream macroinvertebrate communities is transferable among regions and (ii) that higher taxon taxonomic surrogates can be used without restraints to infer species-level community-environment and richness-environment relationships in studies of community ecology, conservation biology and environmental assessment. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

While prokaryotic and eukaryotic microbial diversity is of key importance in ecosystem functioning, its implementation in biomonitoring programs is still largely unappreciated, mainly because of difficulties in identifying microbes and limited knowledge of their ecological functions. Here, we argue that the combination of massive environmental genomics microbial data with machine learning algorithms can be extremely powerful for biomonitoring programs and pave the way to fill important gaps in our understanding of microbial ecology.},

Furthermore, as invasive techniques they can be harmful to individual organisms, populations and habitats. The application of non-invasive sampling methods that extract, isolate and identify nucleic acid sequences (i.e. DNA, RNA) from environmental matrices have significant potential for complementing, or even ultimately replacing, current methods of biological environmental assessment. These environmental DNA (eDNA) and environmental RNA (eRNA) techniques increase spatial and temporal acuity of monitoring, and in the case of the latter, may provide functional information regarding the health of individuals, and thus ecosystems. However, these assessments require robust analysis of factors such as the detectability and specificity of the developed assays. The presented work highlights the current and future uses of nucleic acid-based biomonitoring regimes, with a focus on fish and aquatic invertebrates and their utility for water quality, biodiversity and species-specific monitoring.

  abstract      = {Areas that contain ecologically distinct biological content, called bioregions, are a central component to spatial and ecosystem-based management. We review and describe a variety of commonly used and newly developed statistical approaches for quantitatively determining bioregions. Statistical approaches to bioregionalization can broadly be classified as two-stage approaches that either ‘Group First, then Predict' or ‘Predict First, then Group', or a newer class of one-stage approaches that simultaneously analyse biological data with reference to environmental data to generate bioregions. We demonstrate these approaches using a selection of methods applied to simulated data and real data on demersal fish. The methods are assessed against their ability to answer several common scientific or management questions. The true number of simulated bioregions was only identified by both of the one-stage methods and one two-stage method. When the number of bioregions was known, many of the methods, but not all, could adequately infer the species, environmental and spatial characteristics of bioregions. One-stage approaches, however, do so directly via a single model without the need for separate post-hoc analyses and additionally provide an appropriate characterization of uncertainty. One-stage approaches provide a comprehensive and consistent method for objectively identifying and characterizing bioregions using both biological and environmental data. Potential avenues of future development in one-stage methods include incorporating presence-only and multiple data types as well as considering functional aspects of bioregions.},

  abstract        = {Mapping vegetation as hard classes based on remote sensing data is a frequently applied approach, even though this crisp, categorical representation is not in line with nature's fuzziness. Gradual transitions in plant species composition in ecotones and faint compositional differences across different patches are thus poorly described in the resulting maps. Several concepts promise to provide better vegetation maps. These include (1) fuzzy classification (a.k.a. soft classification) that takes the probability of an image pixel's class membership into account and (2) gradient mapping based on ordination, which describes plant species composition as a floristic continuum and avoids a categorical description of vegetation patterns. A systematic and comprehensive comparison of these approaches is missing to date. This paper hence gives an overview of the state of the art in fuzzy classification and gradient mapping and compares the approaches in a case study. The advantages and disadvantages of the approaches are discussed and their performance is compared to hard classification (a.k.a. crisp or boolean classification). Gradient mapping best conserves the information in the original data and does not require an a priori categorization. Fuzzy classification comes close in terms of information loss and likewise preserves the continuous nature of vegetation, however, still relying on a priori classification. The need for a priori classification may be a disadvantage or, in other cases, an advantage because it allows using categorical input data instead of the detailed vegetation records required for ordination. Both approaches support spatially explicit accuracy analyses, which further improves the usefulness of the output maps. Gradient mapping and fuzzy classification offer various advantages over hard classification, can always be transformed into a crisp map and are generally applicable to various data structures. We thus recommend the use of these approaches over hard classification for applications in ecological research.},

To elucidate this matter, 60 sits were sampled over a two-year cycle, and the BMWP' and ASPT' biotic indices (adaptation of the Biological Monitoring Working Party Score System and Average Score Per Taxon for the Iberian Peninsula) were calculated. Annual variations in the indices were studied (considering, separately, only non-polluted sites, and grouping polluted and clean-water sites together) and compared for changes in temperature, the factor most characteristic of seasonality. Moreover, the correlations with physical factors (altitude, slope of stretch, flow, temperature, distance from the source) and chemical parameters (pH, conductivity, nitrates, nitrites, ammonium, phosphates, chlorides, sulphates, calcium, magnesium, sodium, potassium, COD, iron, copper, zinc, lead, nickel, oils and fats, detergents and pesticides) were analysed. Both indices were found to be negatively related with parameters indicative of pollution. From a multiple regression, a good score prediction using physical and chemical data (for BMWP' as for ASPT') was obtained. For non-polluted sites, the variability of the BMWP' (and its significance with respect to water quality) in relation to seasonality was quite reduced and not significant, but the ASPT' showed a significant dependence on temperature. The relationship of these indices to temperature in all sites (polluted and clean) was negative in both cases, indicating that the relationship is caused more by pollution than by seasonality.}

Four substrates were sampled at each site: riffle litter, pool litter, stony substrates and sediment. Correspondence Analysis indicated that assemblages were primarily more influenced by physical changes (like deforestation and erosion processes) than the water chemistry. The sensitivity of each metric was evaluated through the application of box-and-whisker plot method by its power to assess impairment (metrics should be able to discriminate reference sites from impaired sites) and natural variability (metrics should not discriminate two reference sites). Metrics that failed in at least one of the above premises were not considered as sensitive. In this study, the most sensitive metrics were Shannon index, BMWP-ASPT, %_EPT, and relative abundance of EPT to Chironomidae. {\textcopyright} Springer Science + Business Media, Inc. 2005.},

  abstract = {Freshwater macroinvertebrates provide valuable indicators for biomonitoring ecosystem change in relation to natural and anthropogenic drivers. DNA metabarcoding is an efficient approach for estimating such indicators, but its results may differ from morphotaxonomic approaches traditionally used in biomonitoring. Here we test the hypothesis that despite differences in the number and identity of taxa recorded, both approaches may retrieve comparable patterns of community change, and detect similar ecological gradients influencing such changes. We compared results obtained with morphological identification at family level of macroinvertebrates collected at 80 streams under a Water Framework Directive biomonitoring program in Portugal, with results obtained with metabarcoding from the ethanol preserving the bulk samples, using either single (COI-M19BR2, 16S-Inse01, 18S-Euka02) or multiple markers. Metabarcoding recorded less families and different communities compared to morphotaxonomy, but community sensitivities to disturbance estimated with the IASPT index were more similar across approaches. Spatial variation in local community metrics and the factors influencing such variation were significantly correlated between morphotaxonomy and metabarcoding. After reducing random noise in the dissimilarity matrices, the spatial variation in community composition was also significantly correlated across methods. A dominant gradient of community change was consistently retrieved, and all methods identified a largely similar set of anthropogenic stressors strongly influencing such gradient. Overall, results confirm our initial hypothesis, suggesting that morphotaxonomy and metabarcoding can estimate consistent spatial patterns of community variation and their main drivers. These results are encouraging for macroinvertebrate biomonitoring using metabarcoding approaches, suggesting that they can be intercalibrated with morphotaxonomic approaches to recover equivalent spatial and temporal gradients of ecological change.},

We compared the classifi- cation strengths (CS) of geographic groups (ecoregions and catchments), stream order, and groups based on cluster analysis of fish assemblage data from 200 wadeable streams in the Mid-Atlantic Highlands. We 1st calculated intersite similarity indices (Bray–Curtis on relative abundance; Dice– S{\o}rensen on presence/absence), then compared overall mean within-group similarities (W¯ ) with among-group similarities (B¯). We used subsets of the data to test CS from: 1) 31 reference sites defined on chemistry and habitat criteria, and 2) 21 samples from 8 sites that had been resampled within and between years to estimate the maximum similarity expected for any of the classifications. We assessed the strength of each classification by determining the degree to which W¯ was greater than B¯. Sites classified by taxonomic clusters had higher CS than did sites grouped by stream order, US Geological Survey 4-digit Hydrologic Unit Code (HUC) catchments, and ecoregions. Except for tax- onomic clusters, the CS values were greater when all sites were used in the analysis than when only reference sites were used. The mean similarities for the revisits were 2 to 3 times greater than for all other classifications. We used nonmetric multidimensional scaling as an alternative approach to de- tecting geographic structure in the data. We found little separation of ecoregion or catchment groups except at very broad spatial scales. The relatively weak CS of any of the geographic groups suggests that the interaction of complex zoogeographic patterns and a long history of human disturbance has masked any fine-scale structure of regional fish assemblages.},

Eighty-eight sites that were minimally affected by human activities were chosen to determine the extent to which geographic and stream-based classifications accounted for variation in the composition of riffle macroinvertebrate assemblages. Bray-Curtis similarities among sites were calculated from the relative abundance of macroinvertebrates to assess the strength of classifications based on geography (ecoregions and catchments), habitat (slope and stream order), and water chemistry (conductivity). For comparison, a taxonomic classification (two-way indicator species analysis, TWINSPAN) and a gradient analysis (correspondence analysis, CA) were performed on the macroinvertebrate data. To assess the effect of taxonomic resolution, all analyses were completed at the family level and to lowest practical taxon. The large overall variation within and among ecoregions resulted in a low average classification strength (CS) of ecoregions, although some ecoregions had high CS. Stream order had the highest CS of the habitat and water chemistry classifications. Ecoregion CS increased, however, when stream sites were 1(st) stratified by stream order (ecoregions nested within stream order). Nested ecoregion CS did not increase within 1(st)-order streams, yet increased within 2(nd)- and 3(rd)-order streams. CA ordinations and TWINSPAN classification showed a clear gradient of streams along stream size (order), with a clear separation of 1(st)- and 3(rd)-order streams based on macroinvertebrate composition. The ordinations did not, however, show a distinct clustering of sites on the basis of ecoregions. Overall, the lowest practical taxon level of identification resulted in a clearer pattern of sites in ordination space than did family-level identification, yet only a slight improvement in the different classifications (geographic, habitat, and water chemistry) based on average similarity.},

  abstract        = {One of the biggest challenges when conducting a continental-scale assessment of streams is setting appropriate expectations for the assessed sites. The challenge occurs for 2 reasons: 1) tremendous natural environmental heterogeneity exists within a continental landscape and 2) reference sites vary in quality both across and within major regions of the continent. We describe the process used to set expectations for the multimetric index of biotic integrity (MIBI) and observed/expected (O/E) indices generated from predictive models used to assess stream condition for the US Wadeable Streams Assessment (WSA). The assessment was based on a reference-site approach, in which the least-disturbed sites in each region of the US were used to establish benchmarks for assessing the condition of macroinvertebrate assemblages at other sites. Reference sites were compiled by filtering WSA sample sites for disturbance using a series of abiotic variables. Additional reference sites were needed and were obtained from other state, university, and federal monitoring programs. This pool of potential reference sites was then assessed for uniformity in site quality and comparability of macroinvertebrate sample data. Ultimately, 1625 sites were used to set reference expectations for the WSA. Reference-site data were used to help define 9 large ecoregions that minimized the naturally occurring variation in macroinvertebrate assemblages associated with continental-wide differences in biogeography. These ecoregions were used as a basis for developing MIBI and O/E indices and for reporting results. A least-disturbed definition of reference condition was used nationally, but we suspect that the quality of the best extant sites in ecoregions, such as the Northern Plains and Temperate Plains, was lower than that of sites in other ecoregions. For the MIBI assessment, we used a simple modeling approach to adjust scores in ecoregions where gradients in reference-site quality could be demonstrated conclusively. The WSA provided an unparalleled opportunity to push the limits of our conceptual and technical understanding of how to best apply a reference-condition approach to a real-world need. Our hope is that we have learned enough from this exercise to improve the technical quality of the next round of national assessments. {\textcopyright} 2008 by The North American Benthological Society.},

  abstract      = {Aim To identify the most important environmental drivers of benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages in boreal springs at different spatial scales, and to assess how well benthic assemblages correspond to terrestrially derived ecoregions. Location Finland. Methods Benthic invertebrates were sampled from 153 springs across four boreal ecoregions of Finland, and these data were used to analyse patterns in assemblage variation in relation to environmental factors. Species data were classified using hierarchical divisive clustering (twinspan) and ordinated using non-metric multidimensional scaling. The prediction success of the species and environmental data into a priori (ecoregions) and a posteriori (twinspan) groups was compared using discriminant function analysis. Indicator species analysis was used to identify indicator taxa for both a priori and a posteriori assemblage types. Results The main patterns in assemblage clusters were related to large-scale geographical variation in temperature. A secondary gradient in species data reflected variation in local habitat structure, particularly abundance of minerogenic spring brooks. Water chemistry variables were only weakly related to assemblage variation. Several indicator species representing southern faunistic elements in boreal springs were identified. Discriminant function analysis showed poorer success in classifying sites into ecoregions based on environmental than on species data. Similarly, when classifying springs into the twinspan groups, classification based on species data vastly outperformed that based on environmental data. Main conclusions A latitudinal zonation pattern of spring assemblages driven by regional thermal conditions is documented, closely paralleling corresponding latitudinal patterns in both terrestrial and freshwater assemblages in Fennoscandia. The importance of local-scale environmental variables increased with decreasing spatial extent. Ecoregions provide an initial stratification scheme for the bioassessment of benthic macroinvertebrates of North European springs. Our results imply that climate warming, landscape disturbance and degradation of spring habitat pose serious threats to spring biodiversity in northern Europe, especially to its already threatened southern faunistic elements. {\textcopyright} 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

  abstract      = {The flow regime is recognized as a key factor determining biological and physical processes and characteristics in rivers. Because of this, there is interest in classification and regionalization of rivers in order to delineate patterns in flow regime character at landscape scales. The River Environment Classification (REC) is an priori mapped classification of rivers. The REC is based on a hierarchical model of 'controlling factors', which are assumed to be the dominant causes of variation in physical and biological characteristics of rivers at a variety of spatial scales. The first and second levels of the REC are based on climate and topography and are expected to discriminate rivers according to differences in their flow regimes. Classes are assigned to individual 'sections' of the river network based on categorical description of the climate and topography of each section's unique watershed. This paper describes a test of the REC's ability to explain variation in hydrological character of rivers. Flows that were measured continuously at 335 sites distributed throughout New Zealand were summarized by 13 flow variables and were classified using the REC. Principal components analysis was used to show that the REC classes have distinctive flow regime characteristics. We quantified the classification strength (i.e. the extent to which the mean between-class inter-site dissimilarity exceeds the mean within-class inter-site hydrological dissimilarity) of the REC based on the 13 flow variables. The classification strength of the REC was greater than for two existing, regionalizations and a classification that is based on climate, but which does not account for the river network. We attribute the increased classification strength of the REC to its explicit consideration of the causes of spatial variation in flow regimes among rivers and its representation of the network spatial structure of rivers.

  abstract        = {Water quality agencies and scientists are increasingly adopting standardized sampling methodologies because of the challenges associated with interpreting data derived from dissimilar protocols. Here, we compare 13 protocols for monitoring streams from different regions and countries around the globe. Despite the spatially diverse range of countries assessed, many aspects of bioassessment structure and protocols were similar, thereby providing evidence of key characteristics that might be incorporated in a global sampling methodology. Similarities were found regarding sampler type, mesh size, sampling period, subsampling methods, and taxonomic resolution. Consistent field and laboratory methods are essential for merging data sets collected by multiple institutions to enable large-scale comparisons. We discuss the similarities and differences among protocols and present current trends and future recommendations for monitoring programs, especially for regions where large-scale protocols do not yet exist. We summarize the current state in one of these regions, Latin America, and comment on the possible development path for these techniques in this region. We conclude that several aspects of stream biomonitoring need additional performance evaluation (accuracy, precision, discriminatory power, relative costs), particularly when comparing targeted habitat (only the commonest habitat type) versus site-wide sampling (multiple habitat types), appropriate levels of sampling and processing effort, and standardized indicators to resolve dissimilarities among biomonitoring methods. Global issues such as climate change are creating an environment where there is an increasing need to have universally consistent data collection, processing and storage to enable large-scale trend analysis. Biomonitoring programs following standardized methods could aid international data sharing and interpretation.},

  abstract      = {1. Landscape classifications group tracts of land based on similar physico-chemical attributes that may affect the biological characteristics of streams at local scales. We tested the ability of five landscape models to account for variation in algal and macroinvertebrate biomass, brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) growth and macroinvertebrate community composition from 132 riffles in 15 catchments in the Big Horn Mountains, Wyoming. 2. A model created by the U.S. Forest Service (FS) combined catchment and ecoregion approaches to classify the landscape. Our model used digital elevations to create a landscape classification for streams (DEM). The last three models were based on: (1) standard ecoregions (Ecoregion), (2) the type of underlying bedrock (Geology) and (3) the geographical distance between sites (Site Proximity model). 3. Overall, the Ecoregion and Geology models performed better than the two catchment models (FS and DEM) in predicting local biological characteristics. The Geology model was best at predicting differences in algal and macroinvertebrate biomass, the Site Proximity and Ecoregion models were best at predicting patterns of similarity in macroinvertebrate community composition, and the Site Proximity, Ecoregion, Geology, and FS models, in order from best to worst, accounted for significant variation in brook trout growth. The Site Proximity model performed well because of the effects of spatial autocorrelation. The DEM was consistently one of the worst models at predicting local biological characteristics because it failed to include important attributes (e.g. dominant geology). Calcareous geology was positively associated with greater macroinvertebrate biomass and faster brook trout growth, but it was inversely related to algal biomass. 4. None of the models accounted for a large amount of variation in local biological characteristics. Single-scale, landscape classifications may never accurately predict variation in local biological characteristics because: (1) landscapes show a high degree of spatial heterogeneity, (2) local effects are stronger than landscape attributes and (3) there are too many intervening levels between landscape and local scales in the nested hierarchy of streams. However, landscape classifications did account for significant variation in biological characteristics. Thus, they would be a valuable management tool as part of a multi-scale, hierarchical technique for classifying stream ecosystems. {\textcopyright} 2007 The Authors.},

  abstract        = {1. We intensively sampled 16 western Oregon streams to characterize: (1) the variability in macroinvertebrate assemblages at seven spatial scales; and (2) the change in taxon richness with increasing sampling effort. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) model calculated spatial variance components for taxon richness, total density, percent individuals of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera (EPT), percent dominance and Shannon diversity. 2. At the landscape level, ecoregion and among-streams components dominated variance for most metrics, accounting for 43-72% of total variance. However, ecoregion accounted for very little variance in total density and 36% of the variance was attributable to differences between streams. For other metrics, variance components were more evenly divided between stream and ecoregion effects. 3. Within streams, approximately 70% of variance was associated with unstructured local spatial variation and not associated with habitat type or transect position. The remaining variance was typically split about evenly between habitat and transect. Sample position within a transect (left, centre or right) accounted for virtually none of the variance for any metric. 4. New taxa per stream increased rapidly with sampling effort with the first four to eight Surber samples (500-1000 individuals counted), then increased more gradually. After counting more than 50 samples, new taxa continued to be added in stream reaches that were 80 times as long as their mean wetted width. Thus taxon richness was highly dependent on sampling effort, and comparisons between sites or streams must be normalized for sampling effort. 5. Characterization of spatial variance structure is fundamental to designing sampling programmes where spatial comparisons range from local to regional scales. Differences in metric responses across spatial scales demonstrate the importance of designing sampling strategies and analyses capable of discerning differences at the scale of interest.},

Progress in addressing these issues has been hindered by lack of consensus regarding what a general definition of comparability should be in the context of bioassessments and what measures of comparability are appropriate for ecological data. In this paper, we review the state of knowledge regarding the comparability of assessments as affected by differences in raw data (composition and relative abundance of taxa), derived measures (biotic metrics and endpoint indices), and assessment levels (condition classes). We specifically address the extent to which the comparability of assessments can be compromised by systematic differences in data, discuss the factors known to affect data comparability, and consider the techniques available to evaluate and improve comparability.

The protocols were developed by or adapted from: (1) Toronto and Region Conservation Authority, (2) Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources, (3) Ontario Benthos Biomonitoring Network/Ministry of the Environment, and (4) Canadian Aquatic Biomonitoring Network/ Environment Canada. Summary indices (Hilsenhoff's modified Biotic Index [HBI]; percent of fauna as Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera [% EPT]; number of taxa [S]; and Shannon's Diversity Index [H']) calculated from the resulting data were used to evaluate differences between protocols in a series of analyses including analysis of variance and variance components analysis. The study found that sampling method was an unimportant source of variation in summary index values relative to other factors such as the stream or year sampled. The largest percent variance amongst stream or year factors (main and interactions) was at least three times greater than the corresponding method related percent variances. The results of this study suggest that these four bioassessment methods are interchangeable within the context of large geographic scales or for the detection of major impacts. In cases where impacts to the benthic community arc subtle, protocols should include one or more of discrete habitat sampling, replication, and lower taxonomic resolution. The data and findings here may help agencies integrate different sampling protocols into their biomonitoring and assessment programs. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2007, CAWQ.},

  abstract      = {The assessment of benthic invertebrate community condition is an integral component of freshwater biomonitoring and water quality determination. Several sampling devices have been developed to collect benthic macroinvertebrates, including qualitative, semi-quantitative, and quantitative methods. In this study, we compared several benthic macroinvertebrate metrics and community assemblage measures calculated from data obtained from two sampling methods, namely the Kick- and U-net sampling devices. We reasoned that if the two methods produced similar values for benthic metrics and community composition, then samples collected by these methods should be able to be combined to build larger data sets for use in regional bioassessment analyses. No statistical differences between Kick- and U-net methods were found among standard benthic macroinvertebrate metrics, except for Kicknets collecting more Chironomidae. Invertebrate assemblages were very similar between collection methods, although slightly greater taxonomic richness was found in U-net samples. Bray-Curtis similarity was typically [75% between methods within a stream, while classification strengthsampling- method comparability, an approach for analyzing differences in similarity between groups, indicated invertebrate assemblage similarity between collection methods was virtually identical at approximately 100%. Since these two methods produce similar results, we conclude that benthic macroinvertebrate data collected by these methods can be combined for data analysis and bioassessments with the caveat that mesh size of the sample nets is similar. In addition, if the primary study objective is to assess macroinvertebrate biodiversity, then the U-net sampling device may be more appropriate, despite the slightly greater time needed to complete field sample collection, as it tended to collect a greater diversity of species. {\textcopyright} Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2010.},

The goal of this study was to examine applicability to the reference-condition models of samples collected in other seasons and the effect of taxonomic resolution (genus and family) on model sensitivity to seasonal variation in the benthic invertebrate assemblage. Samples from eight streams representing interior, coastal, and large-river habitats were collected in spring, summer, autumn, and winter of 1995 and in spring of 1996. The benthic invertebrate assemblage changed seasonally such that the models could not be used for seasons other than autumn. The models were equally sensitive to seasonal variation when genus-level or family-level data were used. We recommend that test samples (i.e., samples collected from disturbed sites and meant for comparison with the reference database) be collected either during the autumn or over multiple sampling dates to reduce the possibility that seasonal shifts or stochastic events will lead to erroneous conclusions about the state of a test site.},

  abstract      = {Macroinvertebrate taxon tolerances to human disturbance have been key components of bioassessment since the early 20th century. Initially, tolerances were used to evaluate organic pollution, but more recently, their use has been generalized to evaluate overall disturbance. Numeric tolerance values have been assigned to individual taxa in many previous studies, but their origins can be unknown, and the values can lack empirical basis. We used macroinvertebrate data collected at 1106 stream and river sites in 12 western states sampled during the Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program (EMAP) in 2000 to 2004 to develop macroinvertebrate tolerance values for western US lotic ecosystems. We used principal components analysis to create a 9-variable synthetic disturbance variable (SDV) for overall human disturbance at those sites. The SDV included measures of nutrients, site-scale physical habitat, and catchment-scale land use. For taxa found at ≥20 sites, we calculated tolerance values at multiple levels of taxonomic resolution as the weighted (mean standard deviation) of the SDV at the sites with relative abundances as the weights. We then used the taxon tolerance values and relative abundances at each site to calculate an assemblage tolerance index (ATI) score at several levels of taxonomic resolution. These results should help inform discussions of the level of taxonomic resolution needed for bioassessments. We also discuss how the tolerance values could be used to improve the sensitivity of bioassessment metrics. {\textcopyright} 2010 The North American Benthological Society.},

Specific aims of RBPs for wadeable streams are to indicate the ecological condition of a stream using low-cost protocols to allow long-term and widespread routine monitoring. Our study was part of an ongoing effort to test and standardize a protocol using benthic macroinvertebrates as indicators of the water quality of wadeable streams in southeast Brazil. One of the most controversial issues during RBP development is deciding the taxonomic resolution that should be used. We evaluated how well genus-, family-, and order-level taxonomic resolution detected a gradient of impairment. All 3 taxonomic resolutions statistically discriminated reference, intermediately impaired, and impaired sites based on assemblage structure, water-quality classification, and biotic index responses. Analysis at the genus level was more effective than analysis at other levels of taxonomic resolution for discriminating sites that varied in degradation conditions, especially when considering biotic index responses, but the lack of comprehensive taxonomic keys and information about the ecology of those genera hinder their widespread use in bioassessments. On the other hand, analyses at the order level had lower discriminating power to separate reference sites from intermediately impaired sites when considering biotic index responses. Analyses at the family level gave results similar to results at the genus level, and we support its use in a RBP program for this region, at least until better keys and autoecological knowledge are available.},

  abstract        = {1. We review some of the classic literature on geomorphology and ecology of streams in an effort to examine how theoretical developments in these aquatic sciences have influenced the way fresh flowing waters are classified. Our aim was to provide a historical examination of conceptual developments related to fluvial classification, and to discuss implications for conservation planning and resource management. 2. Periods of conceptual influences can be separated into three overlapping phases each distinguished by theoretical, analytical or technological advances: (i) early Darwinian perspectives; (ii) the quantitative revolution; and, (iii) age of the computer, hierarchy and scale. 3. During the first phase, stream geomorphologists were largely influenced by Darwinian metaphors. The study of stream origin and change through time became more important than the study of stream systems themselves. The idea that streams progress deterministically through successive stages of development seemed to create a veil, most prevalently in North America, that barred analysis of the full scope of variability in these systems for over 50 years. 4. The quantitative revolution brought about many new ideas and developments, including the laws of stream numbers. This period focused on predictive and mechanistic explanations of stream processes, setting the stage for physically based stream classifications that assume that streams can be restored by engineering their physical characteristics. 5. In the most recent 'age of the computer', concepts from the fields of geographic information science and landscape ecology have been incorporated into stream ecology and aquatic classification. This has led to investigations in stream and aquatic ecosystems at hierarchical spatial scales and along different dimensions (upstream/downstream, riparian/floodplain, channel/ground water and through time). Yet, in contrast to terrestrial landscapes, flowing waters are not as easily classified into spatially nested hierarchical regions wherein upper levels can be subdivided into smaller and smaller regions at finer spatial scales. Riverscapes are perhaps best described as directionally nested hierarchies: aquatic elements further downstream cannot be rendered equivalently to elements upstream. Moreover, fully integrated aquatic ecosystem classifications that incorporate lake and river networks, wetlands, groundwater reservoirs and upland areas are exceedingly rare. 6. We reason that the way forward for classification of flowing waters is to account for the directionally nested nature of these networks and to encode flexibility into modern digital freshwater inventories and fluvial classification models.},

The « Hydroecoregion » (HER) approach, previously developed in France, was extended to Europe in the REBECCA project. This approach relies upon the concept of hierarchical ecosystem control. Primary determinants of the functioning of aquatic ecosystems are geology, relief and climate. The base data are geographical layers describing these factors, compiled in a GIS. The common scale of the different layers is 1/1 000 000. The geological map was interpreted according to the lithological structure and properties of the rocks (hardness, permeability, influence on water chemistry). A digital elevation model (DEM) with a pitch of 30 arc second (about 1km) was used to characterize the altitude and the slopes. Hydrogeological maps were also consulted. The climatic factors refer to precipitation (yearly average, seasonal variation) and temperature, interpreted with respect to aquatic ecosystems functioning (water balance). The delimitation of the HER was carried out visually, seeking natural discontinuities for each of the parameters and regional concordances in their distribution. The basic principle was to minimize intra-regional variance and maximize inter- regional differences. A total of 133 HERs was identified at the most detailed level in Europe. These HER were further classified in 9 classes of relief, 21 categories combining relief and litho-morphology, and 9 climatic classes. The concepts, methodology, and the HER map, and the detailed characterisation of these HERs are presented in this report.},

Two different approaches are generally used to construct such typologies. In a top-down approach, environmental variables are chosen on previous knowledge of the general topography of the landscape. In a bottom-up approach, analyses of aquatic communities are used for grouping the streams. In the present study, a typology for Luxembourg's streams is defined with the top-down approach i.e., with abiotic criteria and thus criteria different from those necessary for the assessment of biological conditions (i.e., biotic assemblages). This typological determination is based upon a combination of classification and ordination procedures. A particular emphasis was put on variable characterisation. The results show that six different water stream types were identified using our databases. Typological descriptors are stream dimension, elevation as well as geology. Organic charge, slope and land use rather characterise sites within groups. So, types are defined with criteria independent from any anthropogenic influence or pressure. Such a typology is expected to be relevant for analysing aquatic biota in order to build up a model for the biomonitoring of streams. {\textcopyright} Springer 2005.},

Our approach predicted taxon lists specific to four river types differing in catchment area with a method analogous to the site-specific RIVPACS-type models. The reference sites grouped in accordance with their type in NMS ordination, indicating that the typology efficiently accounted for natural variation in macroinvertebrate assemblages. Compared with a null model, typology greatly increased the precision of prediction and sensitivity to detect human impairment and strengthened the correlation of the ratio of observed-to-expected number of predicted taxa (O/E) with the measured stressor variables. The performance of the typology-based approach was equal to that of a RIVPACS-type predictive model that we developed. Exclusion of rarest taxa with low occurrence probabilities improved the performance of both approaches by all criteria. With an increasing inclusion threshold of occurrence probability, especially the predictive model sensitivity first increased but then decreased. Many common taxa with intermediate type-specific occurrence probabilities were consistently missing from impacted sites, a result suggesting that these taxa may be especially important in detecting human disturbances. We conclude that if a typology-based approach such as that suggested by the European Union's Water Framework Directive is required, the O/E ratio of type-specific taxa can be a useful metric for assessment of the status of riffle macroinvertebrate communities. Successful application of the approach, however, requires biologically meaningful river types with a sufficient pool of reference sites for each type.},

  abstract        = {The EU Water Framework Directive requires European Union Member States to establish ‘type-specific biological reference conditions' for streams and rivers. Types can be defined by using either a fixed typology (System-A), defined by ecoregions and categories of altitude, catchment area and geology, or by means of an alternative characterisation (System-B) that can use a variety of physical and chemical factors. Several European countries also have existing RIVPACS-type models that give site (rather than stream type) specific predictions of benthic macroinvertebrate communities. In this paper we compare the Water Framework Directive (WFD) System-A physical typology and three existing European multivariate RIVPACS-type models as alternative methods of establishing reference conditions. This work is carried out in Great Britain – using RIVPACS, Sweden – using SWEPACSRI and the Czech Republic – using PERLA. We found that in all three countries, all seasons and season combinations, and for all biotic indices tested, RIVPACS-type models were more effective (lower standard deviations of O/E ratios) than models based solely on the WFD System-A variables or null models (based on a single expectation for all sites). We also investigated the explanatory power of whole groups of WFD System-A variables and RIVPACS-type model variables, and the explanatory power of individual variables. We found that variables used in the RIVPACS-type models were often better correlates of macroinvertebrate community variation than the WFD System-A variables. We conclude that this is primarily because while the latter use very broad categories of map-derived variables, the former are based on continuous variables selected for their ecological significance.},

  abstract = {Typology schemes are useful in partitioning natural spatial variability and thus helping implementing bioassessment methods. They have become widely accepted in Europe after the publication of the Water Framework Directive (WFD). The major objective of this study was to test if six Portuguese pre-defined physical stream-types (using System-B of the WFD) are concordant with macroinvertebrate assemblages collected in 31 undisturbed sites in a Portuguese river basin. A top-down (stream types defined by physical attributes) and a bottom-up approach (river classes defined by biological communities) were used. No significant differences were found in the mean number of taxa and abundance of different physical stream types and few taxa are characteristic of specific stream types. Discriminant analysis (DA) considering family-level composition revealed that all stream-types were significantly different and the cross-validation process showed that all stream-types had more than 50% of their samples correctly assigned. On the other hand, the bottom-up approach based on a correspondence analysis (CA) showed some overlap of the macroinvertebrate communities of pre-defined stream types, indicating that variations in the macroinvertebrate community structure was primarily related to altitude, mineralisation and a temporal gradient. DA cross-validation and CA results suggest that tested stream types do not account for natural temporal changes known to affect macroinvertebrate communities in this Mediterranean basin and that the WFD typology should account for these natural variations. The exclusion of natural variability could indicate impairment when it does not exist or no impairment when it does exist (type I and II statistical errors). {\textcopyright} EDP Sciences, 2011.},

The purpose of this paper is the comparison of the efficiency of the main typological systems (based on benthic macroinvertebrates identified at a family level) in Europe in order to find out which is the most appropriate for the Greek rivers. The systems compared were System A and B of the WFD, the River Mediterranean typology (from the Intercalibration Exercise) and the hydro-ecoregions' system of CEMAGREF Institute. The dataset included 98 reference sites from catchments located in Northern and Central Greece. Altitude was the most differentiating descriptor according to Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) affecting the structure of benthic macroinvertebrates. A clear separation of river types, based on benthic macroinvertebrates identified at the family level, was not possible even for the River Mediterranean types. Types were better separated (high R-ANOSIM) based on the composition of benthic macroinvertabrates communities using System B' (according to B) and the River Mediterranean types. System B' presented less overlap between its types and the River Mediterranean descriptors best explained the ordination of reference stations (CCA). It is proposed the use of System B' in the process of the selection of sampling stations for monitoring, especially upstream and downstream point sources of pollution, and the River Mediterranean types for the estimation of ecological quality and additionally, intercalibrated National biotic indices (based on reference sites), since the European Polymetric index STAR_ICMi may be applied only for R-M1, R-M2 and R-M4 river types in Greece.},

  abstract      = {River networks are hierarchical dendritic habitats embedded within the terrestrial landscape, with varying connectivity between sites depending on their positions along the network. This physical organisation influences the dispersal of organisms, which ultimately affects metacommunity dynamics and biodiversity patterns. We provide a conceptual synthesis of the role of river networks in structuring metacommunities in relation to dispersal processes in riverine ecosystems. We explore where the river network best explains observed metacommunity structure compared to other measurements of physical connectivity. We mostly focus on invertebrates, but also consider other taxonomic groups, including microbes, fishes, plants, and amphibians. Synthesising studies that compared multiple spatial distance metrics, we found that the importance of the river network itself in explaining metacommunity patterns depended on a variety of factors, including dispersal mode (aquatic versus aerial versus terrestrial) and landscape type (arid versus mesic), as well as location-specific factors, such as network connectivity, land use, topographic heterogeneity, and biotic interactions. The river network appears to be less important for strong aerial dispersers and insects in arid systems than for other groups and biomes, but there is considerable variability. Borrowing from other literature, particularly landscape genetics, we developed a conceptual model that predicts that the explanatory power of the river network peaks in mesic systems for obligate aquatic dispersers. We propose directions of future avenues of research, including the use of manipulative field and laboratory experiments that test metacommunity theory in river networks. While field and laboratory experiments have their own benefits and drawbacks (e.g. reality, control, cost), both are powerful approaches for understanding the mechanisms structuring metacommunities, by teasing apart dispersal and niche-related factors. Finally, improving our knowledge of dispersal in river networks will benefit from expanding the breadth of cost-distance modelling to better infer dispersal from observational data; an improved understanding of life-history strategies rather than relying on independent traits; exploring individual-level variation in dispersal through detailed genetic studies; detailed studies on fine-scale environmental (e.g. daily hydrology) and organismal spatiotemporal variability; and synthesising comparative, experimental, and theoretical work. Expanding in these areas will help to push the current state of the science from a largely pattern-detection mode into a new phase of more mechanistically driven research.},

  abstract      = {The increasing demand for methods of rapid stream bioassessment has stimulated the evaluation of data simplification. In particular, these studies have assessed how much power is lost when species/morphospecies identification is replaced by family identifications or use of EPT (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera) taxa only. A second simplifying factor commonly evaluated is the use of presence/absence data instead of density. These simplifications have provided valid results in most cases where differences among groups are large, particularly in studies comparing impacted vs. non-impacted stream sites and ecological studies involving large spatial scales. Here I evaluate whether data simplification, both in terms of taxonomic (families, morphospecies of EPT) and numeric (presence/absence) resolutions, is valid for ecological studies done at local scales, where differences among groups are subtle. Datasets used are derived from a five-year study of five stream sites situated in a catchment in southeast Brazil. Streams were sampled twice a year, in the rainy (summer) and dry (winter) seasons. I used Analysis of Similarity (ANOSIM) to evaluate if differences i) among stream sites and ii) between seasons within a stream site, revealed by using the full data set (morphospecies, quantitative data), were also detected when using the simplified datasets. The effect of taxonomic resolution was not significant; the two simplified levels of this factor (morphospecies of EPT, families) were able to recover the same groups revealed by the full dataset. However, the use of presence/absence data had a strong negative effect on the ability to distinguish groups, particularly when differences were small (between seasons within a stream site). The success in recovering groups using simplified taxonomic data agrees with previous evaluations done using datasets from applied fields and those from ecological studies involving large spatial scales. However, in contrast to results observed in applied and large-scale studies, use of simplified data quantification in local datasets resulted in significant loss of information. I suggest that the use of family identifications or morphospecies of EPT are reliable alternatives to the use of species/morphospecies in ecological studies at a local scale. {\textcopyright} 2005 E.

Yet, the distribution of organisms may not coincide with predefined geographical and environmental boundaries, and therefore, biology itself should be leading the classification. In this study, we showed how to arrive at such a biology-based classification by clustering locations based on similarity in species composition. A hierarchical classification structure allowed for the selection of classification levels that suit multiple scales of analysis. We also showed how to objectively identify the number of clusters present in a dataset based on the distribution of specific indicator species, allowing to identify clear boundaries in species composition on multiple scales. The resulting biology-based clusters were identified and characterized by local and regional environmental conditions, showing the limited explanatory power of these environmental conditions and the added value of taking biology itself as a starting point of the classification. By departing community classification from species composition, the unknown environmental, geographical, and biotic drivers influencing species composition are accounted for.},

  abstractnote = {Temporary streams are defined by periodic flow cessation, and may experience partial or complete loss of surface water. The ecology and hydrology of these transitional aquatic-terrestrial ecosystems have received unprecedented attention in recent years. Research has focussed on the arid, semi-arid, and Mediterranean regions in which temporary systems are the dominant stream type, and those in cooler, wetter temperate regions with an oceanic climate influence are also receiving increasing attention. These oceanic systems take diverse forms, including meandering alluvial plain rivers, ‘winterbourne’ chalk streams, and peatland gullies. Temporary streams provide ecosystem services and support a diverse biota that includes rare and endemic specialists. We examine this biota and illustrate that temporary stream diversity can be higher than in comparable perennial systems, in particular when differences among sites and times are considered; these diversity patterns can be related to transitions between lotic, lentic, and terrestrial instream conditions. Human impacts on temperate-zone temporary streams are ubiquitous, and result from water-resource and land-use-related stressors, which interact in a changing climate to alter natural flow regimes. These impacts may remain uncharacterized due to inadequate protection of small temporary streams by current legislation, and hydrological and biological monitoring programs therefore require expansion to better represent temporary systems. Novel, temporary-stream-specific biomonitors and multi-metric indices require development, to integrate characterization of ecological quality during lotic, lentic, and terrestrial phases. In addition, projects to restore flow regimes, habitats, and communities may be required to improve the ecological quality of temporary streams.

Changes in macrohabitat availability from a rifﬂe–pool sequence to isolated pools are among the most conspicuous consequences of connectivity loss. Macroinvertebrate assemblages were compared among 3 distinct stream macrohabitats (rifﬂes [R], pools connected to rifﬂes [Pc], disconnected pools [Pd]) of 19 Mediterranean-climate sites in northern California to examine the inﬂuence of loss of habitat resulting from drought disturbance. At the time of sampling, 10 sites were perennial and included R and Pc macrohabitats, whereas 9 sites were intermittent and included only Pd macrohabitats. Taxa richness was more variable in Pd, and taxa richness was signiﬁcantly lower in Pd than in Pc but not R. These results suggested a decline in richness between Pc and Pd that might be associated with loss of connectivity. Lower Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera (EPT) richness relative to Odonata, Coleoptera, and Heteroptera (OCH) richness was observed for Pd than R and Pc macrohabitats. Family composition was more similar between R and Pc than between R or Pc and Pd macrohabitats. This similarity may be associated with greater connectivity between R and Pc macrohabitats. Correspondence analysis indicated that macroinvertebrate composition changed along a gradient from R to Pc and Pd that was related to a perennial–intermittent gradient across sites. High variability among macroinvertebrate assemblages in Pd could have been related to variability in the duration of intermittency. In cluster analysis, macroinvertebrate assemblages were grouped by macrohabitat ﬁrst and then by site, suggesting that the macrohabitat ﬁlter had a greater inﬂuence on macroinvertebrate assemblages than did local site characteristics. Few taxa were found exclusively in Pc, and this macrohabitat shared numerous taxa with R and Pd, indicating that Pc may act as a bridge between R and Pd during drought. Drought is regarded as a ramp disturbance, but our results suggest that the response of macroinvertebrate assemblages to the loss of hydrological connectivity among macrohabitats is gradual, at least in Mediterranean-climate streams where drying is gradual. However, the changes may be more dramatic in arid and semiarid streams or in Mediterranean-climate streams if drying is rapid.},

Clearcut streams had been logged to the stream banks within 2 y prior to the start of our study. Adult aquatic insects were sampled from a 40-m reach at each study stream in 3 seasons: summer, autumn, and spring. Emergent insects were strong indicators of harvest condition and, regardless of ﬂow duration or season, more aquatic insects emerged from streams in clearcut catchments than in forested catchments. Plecoptera had higher emergence rates from intermittent streams than from perennial streams in spring. Functional feeding group composition was not apparently affected by harvest condition or ﬂow duration. Taxon richness was slightly higher at clearcut than at forested streams, primarily because of the occurrence of rare taxa at clearcut streams. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMS) ordination of emergent aquatic insect assemblages showed community patterns that varied by season and harvest condition, but little by ﬂow duration. Stream canopy % cover, stand age, logging debris (% slash), and substrate composition differed between clearcut and forested streams and were strongly correlated with NMS axes. Taxa that responded to conditions created by logging, such as % slash or canopy opening, contributed to differences in assemblages between headwater streams ﬂowing through clearcut and forested catchments.},

  abstractnote = {1 We investigated the effects of changes in taxonomic resolution on analyses of patterns of multivariate variation at different spatial scales for the highly diverse fauna inhabiting holdfasts of the kelp Ecklonia radiata. 2 Multivariate analyses were performed using several transformations to examine differences in spatial patterns of variation from metres up to hundreds of kilometres for composition vs. relative abundance in assemblages. 3 The greatest variability in assemblages occurred at the smallest spatial scale, from plant to plant, pointing to the existence of important small-scale processes. The proportional amount of variation at the smallest spatial scale decreased with decreasing taxonomic resolution (i.e. from species through to phyla). For composition, the next-greatest source of variation was at the largest spatial scale (hundreds of kilometres), while for relative abundance, the next-greatest source of variation was at the level of sites (hundreds of metres to kilometres). 4 For abundance data, location-level variation became less important and site-level variation became more important with decreasing taxonomic resolution, while for compositional data, the opposite pattern occurred. This suggests that variation in the presence of species or taxa at a particular location along the coast is driven by large-scale processes, while variation in relative abundances within locations is driven by medium-scale processes. 5 The lack of significant variation in the proportional abundances of phyla at large spatial scales suggests that some consistency of pattern may emerge at larger scales (spatial and/or taxonomic), even in the presence of high small-scale variability. These findings strengthen the idea that substantial local variation need not preclude the existence of broad-scale organization in ecological patterns and biodiversity.},

  abstract   = {Biotic homogenization goes beyond the increase in taxonomic similarity among communities. It also involves the loss of biological differences in any organizational level (e.g., populations or communities) in terms of functional, taxonomic or genetic features. There are many ways to measure biotic homogenization, and the results depend on temporal and spatial scales, the biological group, and the richness of the communities. In freshwater ecosystems, the main investigated causes of biotic homogenization correspond to the introduction of non-native species, damming, and changes in land use. However, other natural and anthropogenic causes also increase similarity among aquatic biota, such as climatic change, changes in productivity, and flood and drought events. The consequences of biotic homogenization in freshwater ecosystems are less explored than its causes, despite its severe implications, such as lesser resistant/resilient communities, loss of ecosystem functions, and higher vulnerability to diseases. Finally, biotic homogenization is a complex process that requires attention in conservation strategies, especially because forecasts suggest that freshwater biotas will continue to become more homogeneous in the future.},

  abstract   = {Although rivers are highly structured physically, generalisations about the consequences for macroinvertebrates remain elusive. In part, this reflects the difficulty of quantifying structure per se as well as differentiating the effects on organisms of complexity (i.e. the total abundance of structural features), heterogeneity (i.e. the composition and spatial arrangement of different structural features) and surface area. Three hypotheses about habitat structure were tested at the patch scale ({$<$}0.1 m2) in tributaries of the Rivers Wye and Usk, mid-Wales (U.K.): (i) greater habitat heterogeneity and surface complexity alter macroinvertebrate assemblage composition and increase diversity, richness and abundance, (ii) the effects of complexity on macroinvertebrates are distinct from those of increased surface area, and (iii) habitat structure (heterogeneity and complexity) is a major determinant of variations in macroinvertebrates among habitat types (bedrock, silt, sand, gravel, pebbles and cobbles). Surface complexity, described using fractal dimension, and surface area were estimated from ten riverbed profiles at 0.25 \texttimes{} 0.25 m locations sampled for macroinvertebrates. Habitat heterogeneity was determined within 1 m radii and described by principal components reflecting the patchiness of habitat mosaics (PC1) and the evenness of patch sizes (PC2). Relationships between these heterogeneity PCs, fractal dimension, surface area, habitat type and macroinvertebrates were analysed using models excluding and including habitat type. We also used hierarchical partitioning to investigate the variance explained independently and jointly by each of the variables. Bedrock was the least complex habitat, whilst pebbles were the most complex. Habitat mosaics surrounding cobbles had the most variable patch sizes, whilst those around gravel or bedrock were the most even. Complexity (but not heterogeneity) increased macroinvertebrate diversity and abundance independently of surface area, but independently accounted for {$<$}5\% of the variation in macroinvertebrates. Complexity and surface area also independently increased taxonomic richness, but rarefaction showed that this was an artefact of increased abundances. Habitat type explained more of the variation (up to 21\%) and rendered complexity and surface area redundant in our models. Bedrock, silt and sand typically had reduced diversity, richness and abundance of (mostly) Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera, whilst silt had abundant Chironomidae. These results support the first two hypotheses, but only in part. Habitat heterogeneity did not affect macroinvertebrates, whilst the effects of complexity were weak. The major implication is that habitat type affects macroinvertebrates through factors other than structure alone, and we advocate a wider reappraisal of the processes involved.},

  abstractnote = {Most metacommunity studies indicate that dispersal processes play a minor role compared with species sorting in explaining metacommunity organisation, in particular, in stream systems. However, the role of dispersal could vary with environmental harshness, as a result of frequent resetting of community succession by disturbances and the selection of generalist species from regional species pools. The importance of dispersal may also be mitigated by species dispersal ability. In this study, we explored how species sorting and dispersal shaped invertebrate and fish metacommunities across streams in three tropical headwater catchments in Bolivia with contrasting environmental harshness, including flow regime, altitude and climate conditions. We addressed the hypothesis that the relative roles of dispersal and species sorting vary with environmental harshness: we predicted that the role of species sorting would predominate in benign conditions, whereas that of dispersal would predominate under moderate environmental harshness, and that neither dispersal nor species sorting would be relevant to explain metacommunities under high environmental harshness. We also hypothesised that the role of dispersal would decrease with increasing species dispersal ability. Although there was little or no spatial autocorrelation of environmental distances (i.e. environmental differences) across the headwater catchments, community similarity correlated more strongly with environmental than spatial distances among headwater sites that had low environmental harshness, but the opposite pattern was observed among sites with moderate environmental harshness. Under high environmental harshness, neither environmental harshness nor spatial distances between sites explained community similarity. Under moderate environmental harshness, the correlation between community similarity and spatial distances was the strongest for moderate dispersers of both invertebrates and fish. Yet, in contrast to fish, strongly dispersing invertebrate taxa were spatial structured, suggesting that they were not able to reach all sites as predicted. Our results suggest the role of dispersal might be underestimated, notably in systems prone to environmental harshness. Better proxies for dispersal, along with the use of spatial distances to account for resistance to animal movements in river systems and that account for flow magnitude and directionality, slope, riparian vegetation, wind and streambed roughness, may promote a more realistic integration of dispersal processes in basic and applied metacommunity research.},

  abstract = {The metacommunity concept has the potential to integrate local and regional dynamics within a general community ecology framework. To this end, the concept must move beyond the discrete archetypes that have largely defined it (e.g. neutral vs. species sorting) and better incorporate local scale species interactions and coexistence mechanisms. Here, we present a fundamental reconception of the framework that explicitly links local coexistence theory to the spatial processes inherent to metacommunity theory, allowing for a continuous range of competitive community dynamics. These dynamics emerge from the three underlying processes that shape ecological communities: (1) density-independent responses to abiotic conditions, (2) density-dependent biotic interactions and (3) dispersal. Stochasticity is incorporated in the demographic realisation of each of these processes. We formalise this framework using a simulation model that explores a wide range of competitive metacommunity dynamics by varying the strength of the underlying processes. Using this model and framework, we show how existing theories, including the traditional metacommunity archetypes, are linked by this common set of processes. We then use the model to generate new hypotheses about how the three processes combine to interactively shape diversity, functioning and stability within metacommunities.},

The TIB has been successful in predicting alpha diversity patterns, such as species-area relationships and species-abundance distributions, but lags behind in predicting spatial beta diversity patterns. In this study we use island biogeography theory as the starting point to integrate spatial beta diversity patterns into metacommunity theory. We first derive theoretical predictions for the expected beta diversity patterns under the classic MacArthur and Wilson framework, where all species have equal colonization and extinction rates. We then test these predictions for the avian community composition of 42 islands (and 93 species) in Thousand Island Lake, China. Our theoretical results corroborate that longer distance and smaller area lead to higher beta diversity and further reveal that pairwise beta diversity is independent of the size of the mainland species pool. We also find that for the partitioned pairwise beta diversity components, the turnover component increases with the ratio of extinction rates and colonization rates, while the nestedness component is a unimodal function of the ratio of extinction rates and colonization rates. For the empirical island system, we find that beta diversity patterns better distinguish a species-equivalent model from a species-nonequivalent model than alpha diversity patterns. Our findings suggest that beta diversity patterns provide a powerful tool in detecting nonneutral processes, and our model has the potential to incorporate more biological realism in future analyses.},

A simple method to assess biocontamination is described and tested on benthic macroinvertebrate communities from European inland waterways. This method includes calculations of abundance contamination and richness contamination at ordinal taxonomic rank, from which integrated estimations of biocontamination are derived. Our method can be applied to data collected during routine water quality monitoring, and allows estimation of biocontamination at specific study sites as well as integrated assessment of ecosystems or assessment units. Results clearly show that the main European inland waterways are highly biologically contaminated. They also indicate that richness contamination precedes abundance contamination, and that severe abundance contamination may be caused even by a single ecologically aggressive alien species. Comparison of biocontamination indices and ecological quality status by conventional methods suggests that these metrics are negatively correlated, and richness contamination has a stronger negative affect than abundance contamination. Biocontamination warrants inclusion within the development of holistic estimates of ecological quality status and should be considered in water management policy.},

  abstract = {The implementation of the Water Framework Directive requires a prior typology of aquatic ecosystems based on geographical features. The \guillemotleft{} Hydroecoregion \guillemotright{} (HER) approach, previously developed in France, was extended to Europe in the REBECCA project. This approach relies upon the concept of hierarchical ecosystem control. Primary determinants of the functioning of aquatic ecosystems are geology, relief and climate. The base data are geographical layers describing these factors, compiled in a GIS. The common scale of the different layers is 1/1 000 000. The geological map was interpreted according to the lithological structure and properties of the rocks (hardness, permeability, influence on water chemistry). A digital elevation model (DEM) with a pitch of 30 arc second (about 1km) was used to characterize the altitude and the slopes. Hydrogeological maps were also consulted. The climatic factors refer to precipitation (yearly average, seasonal variation) and temperature, interpreted with respect to aquatic ecosystems functioning (water balance). The delimitation of the HER was carried out visually, seeking natural discontinuities for each of the parameters and regional concordances in their distribution. The basic principle was to minimize intra-regional variance and maximize interregional differences. A total of 133 HERs was identified at the most detailed level in Europe. These HER were further classified in 9 classes of relief, 21 categories combining relief and litho-morphology, and 9 climatic classes. The concepts, methodology, and the HER map, and the detailed characterisation of these HERs are presented in this report.},

  abstract    = {A consistent classification, or stratification, of land into relatively homogenous strata, provides a valuable framework for comparison and analysis of ecological and environmental. The Environmental Stratification of Europe (EnS) provides an appropriate stratification of the European biogeophysical environment. It was constructed using tried-and-tested statistical procedures so that the strata are unambiguously determined and, as far as possible, independent of personal bias data. The EnS aimed to identify relatively homogeneous regions suitable for strategic random sampling of ecological resources, the selection of sites for representative studies across the continent, and the provision of strata for modelling exercises. The dataset provides a generic classification that can be adapted for a specific objective, as well as providing suitable zonation for environmental reporting. The EnS has a 1- km2 resolution, and consists of 84 strata, which have been aggregated into thirteen Environmental Zones (EnZs). Over the last few years the dataset has been used in numerous studies. In the most simple form, the EnZs have been used to provide broad European environmental patterns, and as units for summary reporting. The European Commission has used the EnZs as the basis for assessing High Nature Value farmland and the identification of potential areas for cultivation of bio-energy crops. And the EnS will be developed further under the European Union (EU) European Bio-diversity Network project (EBONE), which aims to create a framework for surveillance and monitoring of species and habitats in Europe. Furthermore, the EnS strata have been linked to climate change scenarios, providing insights into broad environmental shifts, as well as providing a basis for the prediction of future crop yields and changes in biodiversity. Finally, the EnS has been used as a core data layer in a number of other European classifications. In order to better understand the distribution of the diverse range of European environments, and to check the validity of the stratification, this report provides descriptions of all European EnS strata and the aggregated Environmental Zones using ancillary data sources for climate, geology, geomorphology, soils vegetation and land cover},

  abstract   = {Global climate change (GCC) is expected to lead to massive loss of global biodiversity in the alpine regions of mountain ranges. Studies on the potential effects of GCC on low mountain areas remain sparse, however, despite the high conservation value of these areas as biodiversity refugia. We chose a species distribution modeling approach to assess potential GCC impacts on the future distributions of montane freshwater invertebrates under two different greenhouse gas scenarios and three averaged general circulation models. For this, ensemble models consisting of six algorithms [generalized linear model (GLM), generalized boosted model (GBM), generalized additive model (GAM), classification tree analysis (CTA), artificial neural networks (ANN), and multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS)] were applied to project areas of 23 cold-stenothermic aquatic insects from montane regions of Central Europe. We found an average loss of 70\textendash 80\% of the potential distribution for the study species until 2080, depending on the underlying Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change scenario. Species distribution ranges below 1000~m above sea level were found to decrease by up to~\textasciitilde 96\% according to the severest greenhouse gas emission scenario. While the Alps remain the single main refugium under the A2a greenhouse gas emission scenario, the more moderate climate scenario B2a shows fragmented potential persistence of montane insects in some low mountain ranges. The results show that montane freshwater assemblages in low mountain ranges are particularly threatened by ongoing GCC. As vertical dispersal is limited by elevational restriction, low mountain ranges may act as summit traps under GCC. We thus propose that GCC will lead to the extinction of several species and unique genetic lineages of postglacial relict species, resulting in a significant decline in Central European fauna.},

  abstractnote = {Freshwater ecosystems appear to be sensitive to even minor climatic shifts, and the dendritic nature of rivers as well as patchy distribution of habitats within the terrestrial landscape could limit the ability of species to track suitable climate conditions. Although the importance of dispersal is recognised in theory, there is great uncertainty when quantifying the capacity of species to shift their distributions in response to climate change. The influence of dispersal capacity on species’ vulnerability to climate change was assessed, using the modelled projections of 527 freshwater species in New South Wales (NSW), Australia. Species’ future ranges were calculated by iteratively identifying colonisation of accessible habitats and loss of suitable habitats within network models. The accessibility of new habitats was based on a given dispersal mode (aquatic, semi-terrestrial and aerial). The relative impact of dispersal parameters on projected range were evaluated alongside other known sources of uncertainty (climate and emissions scenarios, modelling algorithm and biological group), analysed collectively in a generalised additive mixed-model, and spatially to locate regions of NSW where projections are associated with the most uncertainty. Our simulations (1.4 million scenario combinations) suggest at least a third of species will lose more than half their range under climate change. Nevertheless, we emphasise the broad uncertainty that any average encapsulates. Dispersal capacity only had a minor impact on projected range shifts relative to other modelling assumptions but the network-pathways and maps of uncertainty have value for conservation planning at large scales. Projected range losses initially decreased rapidly as dispersal rates increased but the benefits are reduced above 2–3 km year−1. Taxa restricted to dispersal within the stream network (aquatic) were more vulnerable to climate change than taxa with semi-terrestrial or aerial dispersal and maps of variation due to dispersal mode and rate indicate where habitat connectivity would be most beneficial. This study demonstrates the breadth of uncertainties that challenge plans for improving ecosystem adaptation under climate change and highlights where in the landscape those differences were consistent. We emphasise the need for freshwater conservation studies to be ecologically representative, to focus on broad-scale connectivity for taxa that can move between catchments, and an accessible network of refugia for taxa with more limited dispersal.},

The approach is an extension of matrix regression, designed specifically to accommodate two types of nonlinearity commonly encountered in large-scaled ecological data sets: (1) the curvilinear relationship between increasing ecological distance, and observed compositional dissimilarity, between sites; and (2) the variation in the rate of compositional turnover at different positions along environmental gradients. GDM can be further adapted to accommodate special types of biological and environmental data including, for example, information on phylogenetic relationships between species and information on barriers to dispersal between geographical locations. The approach can be applied to a wide range of assessment activities including visualization of spatial patterns in community composition, constrained environmental classification, distributional modelling of species or community types, survey gap analysis, conservation assessment, and climate-change impact assessment.},
