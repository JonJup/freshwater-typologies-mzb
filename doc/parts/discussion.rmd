# Discussion 

We used four cluster validity metrics to compare the partitioning of macroinvertebrate samples proposed by five different freshwater typologies. 
Three typologies were reach-based (BRT12, BRT20 and GloRiC) and two were regional (Illies and BGR). 
As a reference frame for the cluster validity metrics, we also computed a biological typology of the samples and 100 random typologies.
As we expected, the cluster validity scores of the five freshwater typologies lay in the interval between biological and random typologies in most cases. 
The only exceptions were silhouette widths (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-res-sw)). 

## Comparison of typologies 
Overall, the freshwater ecoregions proposed by @illies1978limnofauna performed best in our assessment followed by BGR, BRT12, GloRiC and BRT20.
Illies' freshwater ecoregions had the highest IVS and classification strength.
While GloRiC is a close second in the IVS, it has the lowest scores in CH and ASW.
Between the two BRT typologies, BRT12 always received better or comparable scores and had the highest $ASW_{max}$ of all typologies. 

The average silhouette widths were remarkably low for all typologies. 
Only BGR had a positive ASW and a higher score than the random typologies. 
The negative ASWs indicate that most communities are on average more similar to communities from other types than to those from their own. 
$ASW_{min}$ gives the largest weight to the separation of clusters without considering compactness. 
It clearly shows a stronger separation between the types of regional typologies than between those of reach-based ones.
It is also at this level that all typologies have positive ASWs and that the difference to random partitions is largest. 
The differences between regional- and reach-based typologies and between all typologies and random typology decrease with increasing $p$.
The negative $ASW_{max}$ indicates that for each of the typologies, there is some community within their type that is more dissimilar to it, than the most dissimilar community from the next closest type.
Overall, we see that the typologies discriminate between different macroinvertebrate faunas. 
They all have CH, CS and IVS larger than purely random typologies. 
However, most types seem to have very similar, neighboring types. 
The assignment of individual communities to a specific type is therefore far from clear, as communities vary as strongly within types as among neighboring ones.  

This result is confirmed by the high similarity between some typical assemblages, especially in the BRT typologies. 
In BRT12, the non-redundant typical assemblages only differentiate between four of the ten types and in BRT20 between six of thirteen. 
While we also found redundancies between typical assemblages in other typologies, they were never between more than two types. 
In both BRT-typologies, we combined low-land river types of different sizes and geologies with calcareous or mixed-geology mid-altitude streams of different sizes.  
It is possible that more finely resolved taxonomic data would be necessary to show differences between these types.
An alternative explanation is, that the BRT typology has too few types. 
Our analysis identified mostly those taxa as common that are sufficiently euryoecious that their distribution is largely independent from the features that delineate the different river types. 
Within the individual river types only few type-specific taxa were common.
This could indicate that even within a single river type environmental conditions vary sufficiently to limit the distribution of more stenooecious species.
It is also possible that common anthropogenic stressors homogenized the assemblages [@Mondy2014]. 
We removed samples from impaired sites to prevent this but the definition of reference conditions and their identification after the fact and at at large spatial scales, 
are difficult [@Pardo2012;@Herlihy2008;@McNellie2020].
However, this would have increased redundancies in all typologies not just the BRT-typologies. 

<!-- BRT20 vs 12 --> 
We had insufficient data to evaluate some of the combinations made to arrive at BRT12 from BRT20.
In most cases, @LycheSolheim2019 merged river types, because one of them was rare (e.g. RT7 or RT20).
Consequently, these were also the river types that had to be omitted from our analysis due to the low number of available samples. 
The high altitude river types in RT14 to 16 are an exception. 
They were combined into RT10 (Highland and glacial rivers) in BRT12, on the grounds that altitude was assumed to be more important than geology or size. 
However, our results lend ambiguous support for the combination to a single high-altitude river type. 
The typical assemblages of highland river types were not redundant in BRT20. 
The corresponding types in Illies (Pyrenees, Alps, Caparthiens and Borealic uplands) or GloRiC (8, 15, 22, 30) were also not redundant. 
However, BGR also only has one high-altitude-type (Alpine) and while it did receive a lower overall score, it received higher scores than Illies for CH and all three variants of ASW. 
As BRT12 generally performed better than BRT20 in this study, the combinations made by @LycheSolheim2019 seem to be justified. 
We suggest that future studies should rather employ the aggregated than the full typology. 
However, given the low performance of reach-based typologies in general, we advise caution when assuming spatially homogeneous reference communities within them. 


## Typical assemblages 

In the following the typical assemblages of the BRT-type typologies are discussed, which was the main scope of this study (see supplementary information for the typical assemblages of other types)
Several taxa are tramp taxa (sensu @McGeoch2002).
They are part of all typical assemblages. 
These taxa are: the snail Ancylus, the mayfly Baetis, the dipteran family Chironomidae, the caddisfly Hydropsyche and the beetle Limnius. 
<!-- Are they known to be euryoecious ?--> 

The typical assemblages of very large rivers (RT1 in BRT12 and BRT20) harbor many genera that include invasive species like *Dreissena polymorpha*, *Dikerogammarus villosus*, *Corbicula fluminea* and  *Potamogyrus antipodarum*. 
The presence of these taxa in the typical assemblages highlights the prominent role that neozoa play in very large rivers [@Leitner2020].
The typical assemblages of very large rivers are also the only ones that lack the beetle Elmis, the caddisfly Rhyacophila and the mayfly *Serratella ignita*.
Elmidae breath through plastrons and thus require high oxygen saturation, which is rare in very large rivers.
The genus Rhyacophila encompasses a diverse array of species that occur from large lowland stream [e.g. *Rhycophila dorsalis*, @Dohet2008] to high-altitude streams [e.g. *Rhyacophila torrentium* and *Rhyacophila vulgaris*, @Lorenz2004] but seldomly in very large streams.
The typical assemblages of very large rivers contain the most specific taxa, i.e. taxa that do not occur in other typical assemblages.
On one hand, these are most of the neozoa listed above. 
Besides Potamogyrus, which occurs in most typical assemblages, these taxa are only typical for very large rivers. 
On the other hand, there are taxa such as the mayflies Cleon, Procleon and Heptagenia as well as the caddisfly Oecetis. 
These taxa all include taxa that are known to be potamophil, e.g. *Cleon dipterum*, *Heptagenia flava* and *Oecetis notata* [@Nagell1978; @Dohet2008; @westermann1997bemerkenswerte]. 
<!-- siliceous lowland --> 
The siliceous lowland river types of  RT4/5 (BRT12) and RT2/3 (BRT20) are mostly made up of caddisfly, mayfly and beetle genera. 
These genera include several species that are typical for the rhitral, such as  *Esolus parallelepipedus*, *Elmis aenea* and *Hydropsyche pellucidula*. 
In addition, all four contained Pisidum clams and Calopteryx damselflies. 
<!-- calcerous lowland --> 
In the typical assemblages of calcareous or mixed lowland river of RT2/3 (BRT12) and RT 4/5 (BRT20) we can find many of the same taxa as for the siliceous types. 
The most notable differences are the presence of Riolus beetles, the damselfly Platycnemis and the gammarid Echinogammarus as well as the absence of the mayfly Ecdyonurus and the stonefly Leuctra. 
Riolus species, such as *Riouls cupreus*, are known to prefer calcareous streams [@hebauer1986kafer; @Elliott2008; @Lorenz2004]. 
<!-- siliceous midaltitude -->
The differences are more pronounced when we move towards mid-altitude river types.
The typical assemblages of silicoues mid-altitutde rivers in RT 8/9 (BRT12 and BRT20) have unique stonefly taxa (Nemoura and Perla), a unique beetle taxon (Dupophilus) and two unique mayflay taxa (Ephemerella and Habrophlebia). 
Ecdyonurus, which are included in the lowland siliceous river types but absent from the calcareous ones, are also included. 
<!-- calcareous midaltitude --> 
The typical assemblages of calcareous and mixed mid-altitude rivers (RT6/7 in BRT12 and RT10/11 in BRT20) are similar to those of lowland calcareous streams. 
Both have the mayfly Centropilumn and the snail Radix in the large but not the small rivers. 
The most noticeable differences are that the gammarid Echinogammarus is part of both lowland typical assemblages and absent from the mid-altitude types while the opposite holds for the dipteran family Simuliidae.
<!-- High altitude          --> 
The high altitude types RT10 (BRT12) as well as RT14, 15 and 16 (BRT20) contain no unique taxa. 
If at all, these typical assemblages are distinct through the taxa they lack. 
The mussel Pisidium, the gammarid Gammarus, the mayfly Ephemera and the damselfly Calopteryx occur in all typical assemblages except for these. 

## Ecology of regional and reach-based typologies 

<!-- Regional outperform local --> 
Overall, regional approaches that assign large contiguous areas to a single type were a better summary of our extensive data set of invertebrate occurrences than reach-scale typologies.  
The constraints of our study may have played in favor of regional approaches. 
The taxonomic resolution of our data only allowed inferences at the genus level.
Potentially, species-level data would have highlighted bigger differences at smaller scales and hence been better summarized by typologies with smaller mapping units.
Along the same lines, @Moog2004 showed that higher taxonomic resolution was necessary to delineate smaller ecoregions and the same logic could expand to reach-scale typologies. 
Similarly, @Verdonschot2006 showed that differences in classification strength were noticeable between 'best-available' and family-level data on a pan-European scale. 
However, the difference was small and their analysis should not be extrapolated to infer if this difference also exists between species- and genus-level data.
@Hawkins2000 note that, across taxa groups and typologies, higher taxonomic resolution does not always lead to greater classification strength.   
Additionally, the likelihood of assigning an observation to the wrong type due to inaccuracies in the spatial data are lower for regional typologies, where such mistakes can only happen toward the borders between types.
We reduced this error by using a more stringent distance-to-river criterion for the selection of sites than similar studies. 
For example, @Irving2018 used a cutoff of 3 km to assign streamflow gauging stations to rivers. 
Very small rivers are largely missing from the river network representations used by GloRiC and the BRT as provided in @globevnik2019btfr. 
Hence, samples from these rivers are either omitted from the analysis if they are too far removed from the next river or assigned to the next river segment.
In most cases, this is likely but not certainly a reach of a similar type. 
New and more highly resolved river networks [e.g. @Lin2021] might provide more accurate mapping of river types and ameliorate these problems. 

It is worthwhile to interpret the patterns we observed in light of metacommunity theory. 
Our analysis of generalized silhouette widths showed that the separation between communities of different BRT types decreases when we give more weight to outliers. 
The separation declines up to a point where it is lower than in the random typologies. 
This pattern could be explained by strong dispersal limitation leading to divergent communities in comparable environments.
The spatial distance between the instances of different types in reach-scale typologies is often small. 
Typically, landscapes and catchments are made up of mosaics of different river types. 
In positing that assemblages vary between instances of different reach-scale types, we implicitly assume that dispersal is strong enough for species to track variation in local conditions [@leibold2004metacommunity] but not so strong that mass effect can overrule environmentally induced patterns [@mouquet2003community].
If taxa are strongly limited by dispersal e.g. through historical and anthropogenic dispersal barriers [@leibold2010metacommunity;@Belletti2020] or through the sheer distance between sites, they are unable to reach potentially favorable sites.
In our case, stronger dispersal limitation would lead to larger differences between sites of the same type. 
Dispersal limitation leads to a pattern known as distance decay, which is often found at large spatial scales [@nekola1999distance; @morlon2008general] but varies in its magnitude between taxa, realms and degrees of latitude [@graco2021distance].
Studies have found  both, invertebrate communities that are predominantly structured by environment [e.g. @heino2012context; @landeiro2012roles] and those that are structured by space [@mykra2007scale;@astorga2012distance]. 
However, even for microbes, which under the Bass-Becking hypothesis ("everything is everywhere but the environment selects") were long considered to have cosmopolitan distributions [e.g. @Finlay2002], the role of dispersal limitation, at least at large spatial scales, is becoming evident [@Telford2006; @soininen2012macroecology; @lindstrom2012local].

<!-- Small scale vs. regional --> 
The better performance of regional typologies might also be taken to support the notion, that aquatic macroinvertebrate communities are adapted to changes in large-scale rather than small-scale variables. 
Many studies have investigated this question before.
Among them are studies that have studied the explanatory potential of ecoregions, which might be considered as categorical combinations of large-scale environmental conditions like climate, geology and altitude.
@Verdonschot2004 used the data compiled during the AQEM project to investigate potential drivers of macroinvertebrate community composition. 
They found that the distribution of macroinvertebrates follows Illies' freshwater ecoregions and that large-scale variables like geology explain most of the variation. 
However, using an extended data set, that included data from both AQUEM and STAR, @Verdonschot2006b found ecoregions to be a rather weak predictor of invertebrate community composition. 
Similarly, ecoregions explained a negligible amount of variance in community composition in Swedish boreal rivers [@Johnson2004].
The review of @Hawkins2000 finds that ecoregion-based approaches usually outperform catchment-scale classifications.
However, the classification strength was generally low and lay between 0.07 and 0.16, which slightly exceeds the ones we found (between `r cs_gl` to `r cs_ill`) but is in agreement with several other studies [e.g.  @Snelder2004; @Heino2006; @Mykra2009; @Vasconcelos2013]. 
The interplay between local and regional control cannot be considered detached from the previous discussion of dispersal limitation since the degree to which assemblages are regulated regionally or locally likely depends on the magnitude of dispersal [@ryabov2011graphical].
Synthesis of these findings is impeded by the fact that many of the studies relied on combinations of variance partitioning and eigenfunction analyses that have been shown to be flawed [@gilbert2010partitioning; @smith2010variation; @tuomisto2012modelling].
An alternative method to evaluate the importance of dispersal processes for community assembly was recently proposed [@Vilmi2020] but has yet to be extensively tested and applied. 

<!-- Biotic interactions --> 
Typologies based on environmental variables cannot account for the effects of biotic interactions on species distributions.
While these received much attention in the early days of macroecology [@diamond1975assembly;@connor1983interspecific] the focus shifted towards environmental filters [e.g. @whittaker1970communities; @pearson2003predicting] assuming that biotic interactions are only important at local scales. 
Their role for macroecology has been revisited [e.g. @Wisz2013] partly due to the realization that many studies can not differentiate between environmental filtering *sensu stricto* and biotic interactions [@Kraft2015].
Propelled by a series of new methods [e.g. @Popovic2019; @ovaskainen2020joint] several studies have recently investigated the effect of biotic interactions on larger biogeographical patterns. 
While some indicate, that the role of environmental conditions is more important than that of biotic interactions [@elo2021does], others suggest that biotic interactions modulate the response to the abiotic enviornment [@Abrego2021]. 

<!-- Ways forward -->
## Conclusions and outlook   

While there were clear and systematic differences between typologies, all cluster validity metrics had comparatively low scores. 
It is beyond the scope of the current study to assess whether this is a problem of the implementation or a general issue, i.e. if it is theoretically possible to create environmental typologies that capture large amounts of variation between communities or if niche processes or environmental filters *sensu stricto* [@Kraft2015] generally explain insufficient variance.
The latter would constitute a serious problem for the reference state approach as this would entail that spatial stability of reference communities [@Statzner2001] should generally not be assumed. 
However, since several studies have found typologies to explain a significant amount of variation [e.g. @Lorenz2004;@Johnson2007] we deem issues with the implementation more likely.  
The river typology of the WFD must be optimized not only for macroinvertebrates but for all four biological quality elements (macroinvertebrates, diatoms, fish and macrophytes) [@Dodkins2005].
Future studies should assess whether the conclusions drawn from this study are supported by results for the other taxa groups. 
River classifications must be understood as models [@Goodwin1999; @Loveland2004]. 
Alongside our growing knowledge about freshwater systems, we should strive to further improve them, as to increase their value for biomonitoring and to render them more effective tools for conservation. 
Our study has shown that the BRT typologies should not be the end of this effort. 

<!-- 
Further developments would do good to consider metacommunity dynamics [@Cid2020] and to incorporate mechanisms to prepare for the possible con- and divergence between and within river types due to climate change [@Loveland2004; @Arneth2020]. 

Furthermore, it remains unclear whether current ecoregions or river classes will change uniformly with future climate change or will con- and diverge. 
Environmental legislative frameworks must acknowledge that climate change, and other anthropogenic and natural processes, will alter their subjects and encompass faculties to accommodate these changes
