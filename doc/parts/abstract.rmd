<!-- SETUP --> 
Human actions alter the composition and functioning of ecological communities globally. 
This transformation is especially rapid and intensive in freshwater ecosystems. 
Comprehensive and international regulatory frameworks are necessary to slow down, halt and reverse the ongoing loss of freshwater biodiversity. 
These regulatory frameworks, such as the Water Framework Directive (WFD), typically simplify freshwater ecosystems through classification systems that use selected features to derive a typology. 
A recently proposed pan-European typology for lotic freshwater systems (broad river types, BRT) has unified the assortment of existing national typologies but lacks biological validation. 
<!-- CONFRONTATION --> 
Using cluster validity analyses, we evaluated whether freshwater macroinvertebrate communities are more similar within then among the BRT river types. 
In addition, we compared it's ability to delineate assemblages to that of three other freshwater typologies.
Moreover, we derived lists of taxa that typically occur within the types of each typology and evaluated their similarities.
Finally, we also compared two fundamentally different approaches to classifying rivers: reach-based and region-based typologies.   
<!-- RESOLUTION --> 
Though performance differed between validity metrics, the BRT typology rarely ranked among the best.
This was confirmed by our finding that macroinvertebrate faunas of different BRT-types were more similar to each other than in the other typologies. 
Overall, regional typologies achieved better scores than those based on reaches.
However, no typology achieved high cluster validity scores.
<!-- EPILOGIE -->
Our findings indicate that superior alternatives to the new pan-European rivers typology already exist but also that none reliably delineate demarcations between internally homogeneous macroinvertebrate communities. 
Further improvement of freshwater typologies has the potential to benefit macroecological research, improve biomonitoring and render conservation efforts more effective.

##### ----- OLD DRAFTS ----- ##### 

To reduce the impact of known stressors and prevent the emergence of new ones, comprehensive international regulatory frameworks are necessary. 
The Water Framework Directive (WFD) aims to achieve this for the European Union.
Despite missing its initial target of elevating all waterbodies to good quality in 2015, it has let to considerable progress in our knowledge of European waterbodies as well as new and improved methods for biomonitoring.
Central to the WFD the division of freshwater systems into types, each with different reference conditions. 
While national states use national typologies for their evaluations, a Pan-European typology of rivers has recently been proposed. 
Here we evaluate whether this typology is a good classifications of aquatic macroinvertebrate communities, compare it with other freshwater typologies, and derive typical and indicator taxa for its types.
To this end, we 
All our analyses indicate, that macroinvertebrate differ between some of the proposed types but large redundancies reamin.
